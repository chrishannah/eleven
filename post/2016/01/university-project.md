<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>I&#8217;m currently studying Computer Science at London Metropolitan University, and in my final year I will have to come up with a project to do.</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;m only in my second year and I will start the third year in around September, we&#8217;ve been told to start thinking of ideas now. So I will start a new section on this website and hopefully start thinking of things I can do.</p>
<p>According to my lecturer the most popular projects seem to be websites or mobile applications. I think I&#8217;d prefer to make an app of some sort, or if I do make a website then it will be more of a service.</p>
<p>Once we work out a few ideas, we then have to then submit them to see if they&#8217;re good enough to warrant a grade at the end. It can&#8217;t be too simple and it can&#8217;t be too complex, therefore I better think of a few!</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s the introduction done, if you want to see how it&#8217;s going then you can just go to the <a href="https://chrishannah.xyz/tag/university/">University section</a>. Otherwise you can follow me on Twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/chrishannah">@chrishannah</a>.</p>
