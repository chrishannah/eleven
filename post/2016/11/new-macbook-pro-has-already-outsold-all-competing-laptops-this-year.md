<p>Joe Rossignol has reported over at MacRumors, that the new MacBook Pros have already outsold their competitors for the current year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slice Intelligence says the new MacBook Pro accumulated more revenue from online orders during its first five days of availability than the Microsoft Surface Book, ASUS Chromebook Flip, Dell Inspiron 2-in-1, and Lenovo Yoga 900, based on e-receipt data from 12,979 online shoppers in the United States.</p>
<p>The new MacBook Pro generated over seven times the revenue that the 12-inch MacBook did over its first five days of availability, according to Slice Intelligence. If accurate, that means it took the new MacBook Pro just five days to accumulate 78% of all the revenue generated by the 12-inch MacBook since its April 2015 launch. &#8211; <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/09/new-macbook-pro-has-outsold-all-competitors/">MacRumors</a></p>

<p>If this is true, I think it&#8217;s pretty impressive!</p>
