title: Making a Device Your Home
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>This article comes from my newsletter, which I have stopped after just 3 issues. It was just an idea that didn&#8217;t work out for me personally, as it required a more focussed piece every week. And I realised I prefer the shorter and quicker form of writing, that I do here on Radical Thinker.</p>
<p>So here is the last issue, which is about personalising your devices.</p>
<hr />
<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll understand that a house is not always a home, as you have to do some level of customisation to make sure it fits with your desires and needs. You add a sense of personality to transform it into a home.</p>
<p>Well I believe that you can apply the same idea into technology, and the devices you use everyday, because they are your &#8220;virtual home&#8221;.</p>
<p>So why shouldn&#8217;t it be comfortable?</p>
<p>The first place everyone starts off with is the wallpaper, it&#8217;s a pretty big part of a device, especially when it&#8217;s the lock screen and the home screen. But this isn&#8217;t true personality, as you&#8217;ve still got the same device as everyone else.</p>
<p>The little things that make a difference are cool cases, different coloured covers, putting stickers on your devices, and then there’s even the way you set up and layout your devices.</p>
<p>I’m a big sticker fan myself, and you can see below what it looks like:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-611" src="https://cdn.chrishannah.me/images/2016/11/6dad104a-c0be-4025-a4c1-f3818139d9c3.jpeg" /></p>
<p>It’s not much, but the stickers are things that I like, and it feels mine when I’m holding it. I find it really interesting to see what other people do to their devices as well, I’ve seen some cool creations in the past.</p>
<p>So for the software side of things, using iOS as an example, your app layout and selection of apps can really change the feel of a device as well. I’ve previously been a person who likes to keep things standard, that’s fine I guess, but it’s not fun.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to move SnapChat into your Dock, delete Mail from your iPhone, or even set cat noises as your ringtone.</p>
<p>I think if you have a laptop, tablet, and sometimes even a phone, don’t hesitate to personalise it. It is yours after all.</p>
<p>I’d love to hear other peoples thoughts on this, and also see any of your customised devices!</p>

<p><em>P.S. Just because I don&#8217;t write for the newsletter, it doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ll stop writing these types of articles. I&#8217;ll just post them here instead!</em></p>
