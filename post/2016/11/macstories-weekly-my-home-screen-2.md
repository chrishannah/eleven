title: MacStories Weekly - My Home Screen
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>A few weeks back in issue #56 of the Club MacStories Weekly newsletter, I wrote about my current home screen, and what I changed when moving to my iPhone 7 Plus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the iPhone 7 being released, I took that as my chance to join the infamous Plus Club. And with that, I thought I would look at a different way to organise my Home screen as my previous 5S was just one page of well categorised folders. With this new shiny toy, I started fresh with a Home screen of my most used apps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once your a member, you can find my home screen in <a href="https://club.macstories.net/newsletter-archive/?ref=radicalthinker">the archive</a>, and it&#8217;s &quot;MacStories Weekly: Issue 56&quot;.</p>
