<p>Phil Schiller, the Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing for Apple, has sat down with The Independent to talk about the latest MacBook Pro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We first talked in an Apple-white private room at Infinite Loop, the companyâ€™s Californian headquarters, minutes after the new laptops had been unveiled and followed up a few days later&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The questions range from why the SD card slot has been omitted, the evolution of the Touch Bar, why Siri is only just coming to the Mac, and more. It&#8217;s a pretty interesting interview, and I always like these things that usually come after big announcements, because you get a small sense of what they are thinking inside Apple, and their motivations.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one bit that I didn&#8217;t expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before. So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it. &#8211; Phil Schiller</p>
</blockquote>
