<p>Who would of thought it, <a href="http://twitter.com/ismh">Stephen Hackett</a> writing a book about old Macs.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bondi iMac — and the family of colorful computers that came after it — brought some much-needed clarity and excitement to the Mac line.</p>
<p>More importantly, it bought Apple time to integrate NeXT&#8217;s technology and build Mac OS X from the ashes of the aging Mac OS.</p>
<p>This book looks at these parallel projects with a consideration of Apple&#8217;s best product: the company itself. &#8211; <a href="https://aquaandbondi.com">Aqua and Bondi</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve just purchased the book myself, and I&#8217;m looking forward to reading about the early stage of Apple, that really changed the company.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/book/aqua-and-bondi/id1181116653?mt=11&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=rt">Aqua and Bondi on the iBooks Store</a>, or alternatively as a <a href="https://aquaandbondi.com">PDF from the website</a>.</p>
