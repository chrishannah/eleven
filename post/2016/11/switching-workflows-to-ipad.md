title: Switching Workflows to iPad
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Matt Gemmell is another person that is switching to an iPad lifestyle, and with that he&#8217;s posting a series of iPad related articles as he moves platform.</p>
<p>As he writes a weekly newsletter, there is a few things he does on a Mac that needed to be ported over to a new way of thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I offer a membership option for this site, which comes with some cool benefits including an email newsletter every Monday morning (with an exclusive essay, and behind-the-scenes info on my current writing projects, amongst other things).</p>
<p>Because my beloved members support my writing during the long periods between releasing novels, finding a workflow for preparing the weekly newsletter was my first priority for going iPad-only. &#8211; <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/ipad-workflow-membership-newsletters/">MattGemmell</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find these types of posts quite interesting, as I&#8217;m always looking for more things to do on my iPad. Although I don&#8217;t plan on fully switching platform, as I&#8217;ve just ordered a new Mac!</p>
