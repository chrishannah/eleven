<p>My friend <a href="http://imlefthanded.com/2016/09/evernote/">Elliot Clowes on Evernote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As I type this Evernote is on my second monitor to my left. It’s been there all day during which it’s been referred and added to many times. I live in Evernote. But despite that I don’t love it. In fact it seems during the eight years I’ve been using it, I like it less and less each year.</p></blockquote>
<p>I used to be a big Evernote user myself, with it providing the note-taking infrastructure for my first two years of university. I have since moved on because of problems similar to what Elliot talks about.</p>
<p>But with their recent <a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2016/09/13/evernotes-future-cloud/">move to Google Cloud Platform</a>, he has a few good pointers for how they could really improve Evernote as a product and service.</p>
<p>You can read the full post on his blog, <a href="http://imlefthanded.com/2016/09/evernote/">I&#8217;m Left Handed</a>.</p>
