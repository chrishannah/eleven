title: Tesla's Radar Eyes

<p>Elon Musk <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/upgrading-autopilot-seeing-world-radar/">writing on the Tesla blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Taking this one step further, a Tesla will also be able to bounce the radar signal under a vehicle in front &#8211; using the radar pulse signature and photon time of flight to distinguish the signal &#8211; and still brake even when trailing a car that is opaque to both vision and radar. The car in front might hit the UFO in dense fog, but the Tesla will not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can probably guess, this is an article about the latest update to the Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot system. They&#8217;re doing some cool things with the radar, and I always find it interesting to see what they&#8217;re up to (Even if I don&#8217;t even own <em>any</em> car).</p>
