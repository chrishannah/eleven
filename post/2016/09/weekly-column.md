<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>I&#8217;m starting something new, <em>again</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to do a regular piece of writing, be it on a tech blog, magazine, or anything where I can cover a specific piece of news or opinion. But opportunities for this don&#8217;t come around very often, so I thought why not just start it myself?</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m going to now try and write one piece every week (separate to this blog), and share it via an email newsletter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all powered by <a href="http://tinyletter.com">TinyLetter</a>, and I love how everything is very minimal, and focuses on plain content. I don&#8217;t want to create more junk for your inbox, so hopefully a small email every week will suffice.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t got any guidelines for myself yet, but I will aim to keep it around 500 words.</p>
<p>It would be awesome if you subscribed, I will get writing the first column and it will go out every Friday for your weekend reading.</p>
<p>You can subscribe using the form below, or by going to the <a href="http://tinyletter.com/chrishannah">TinyLetter page</a>.</p>
