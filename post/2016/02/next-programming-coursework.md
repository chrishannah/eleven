title: Next Programming Coursework!
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>I&#8217;ve been set some more coursework for my &quot;Data Structures &amp; Specialist Programming&quot; module at Uni, and it&#8217;s good timing as I&#8217;ve been running out of things to do.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem too complicated at a first glance, we have to make a web application in Java, which is what we&#8217;ve been taught for the past 2 years. The website must feature a mix of dynamic and static pages, and use Java EE server-side technology and a backend database &#8211; I&#8217;ll probably use MySQL because I&#8217;ve done a lot of that before.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t really a specification on what need to be in the website,  apart from some basic database functions, some Ajax (probably a search option), and certain Java components. I&#8217;m assuming we&#8217;ll learn the detail in the lectures.</p>
<p>We did however have to choose a topic, and each person has to choose a unique topic. We got sent a list of topics we could choose from and my first choice was Planets, but this was already taken! So Mountains it is.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t given it too much thought yet, but I&#8217;m thinking a website containing a database of 100 or so Mountains, with the ability to search, sort, filter etc.  I&#8217;ll start it soon hopefully and any decent work will be posted here!</p>
