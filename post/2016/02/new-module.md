<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Today I start a new module at university &#8211; Professional Issues, Ethics, and Computer Law. It sounds a bit boring to be honest, but I have seen that we&#8217;re learning about Edward Snowden which is okay I guess. I probably know most of that stuff already but it&#8217;s better than being taught something boring.</p>
<p>We were supposed to read around 45 pages of some random book, but I haven&#8217;t done that yet. And the class is in 4 hours. Oh well.</p>
<p>Lets just hope it isn&#8217;t boring.</p>
