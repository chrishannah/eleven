title: What do I want to do?
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>For a while now I’ve been trying to work out what I want to do when I finish university. There has always been two primary desires of mine &#8211; to create applications and tools for people, and also to write, whether it’s a blog or a news outlet.</p>
<p>Recently, and especially after redesigning this blog, I’ve started to think about my web presence. And in general trying to boil everything down so I have fewer things that I’m doing, and trying to instead focus on quality over quantity.</p>
<p>Basically, I’m taking my finger out of some of the pies<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>After doing some more programming at university (unfortunately some of it was Java Web), I’ve started to work on some fun projects. And I want to head more in this direction, as it’s probably going to help me figure out what I really want to do.</p>
<p>Recently I made a <a href="https://github.com/cryptixdevelopment/WeatherByEmoji">small website which displays the weather in emoji</a>, and I’ve worked <a href="https://github.com/cryptixdevelopment/command">on an extension to a really cool project</a> called Command that lets you use Slack-style commands on the web. I’ve got a few more ideas in my head for apps, and also some website projects that I may continue with friends at university. But I’ve got quite a bit of coursework that I should be doing at the moment, so that will have to wait.</p>
<p>Another thing I’m wondering about is what I do with <a href="http://www.apprecap.net">App Recap</a>, I do enjoy what I do there, but sometimes I really just don’t have the time to write anything for it, and I don’t think it can reach its full potential without constant updates. I guess I have some thinking to do.</p>
<p>There is some good news that has come this week though, and that’s my new part time job for <a href="http://www.getblogo.com">Blogo</a>! I have already created a bunch of support articles for their website, and now I will be actually responding to users, and helping them fix whatever issue they have. If you haven’t heard of Blogo, then it’s a really awesome blogging app for Mac and very soon it will be on iOS as well. You can <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/blogo-blogging-app-for-wordpress/id902111700?ign-mpt=uo%253D4&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=website&amp;mt=12">check out the app on the Mac App Store</a>.</p>
<p>Also I should be writing a piece for my university magazine which will be cool, I asked them a while ago if they want anything app related writing up, and they said it&#8217;s a great idea! So I just need to wait for the next meeting to get started.</p>
<p>That’s my thoughts for now, and if you every want to see what I’m up to, or even have a chat, then <a href="http://www.twitter.com/chrishannah">Twitter’s always best</a>. And I guess as I’m slowly doing more programming, you may want to keep an eye on my <a href="https://github.com/cryptixdevelopment">GitHub</a> as well.</p>
