title: Getting Started with IFTTT
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown"><!-- link[http://katiefloyd.com/blog/getting-started-with-ifttt] --></p>
<p>The need and desire for automation in our daily lives is constantly growing, and IFTTT is one of the main services you can use to link many different actions together. It&#8217;s probably <em>the</em> automation service for the web.</p>
<p>The only problem with things like this, is that it takes a while to get used to how it works, and also how to get the best out of it.</p>
<p>Luckily, Katie Floyd has written a <a href="http://katiefloyd.com/blog/getting-started-with-ifttt">great article explaining the fundamentals of IFTTT</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IFTTT, which is short for If This Then That, is a web-based service that allows users to create simple recipes to control web-connected devices and services. I’ve talked about IFTTT quite a bit on my podcast, but one of the comments I receive regularly is that people just don’t quite not how to get started, or aren’t sure how IFTTT can fit in their life. To help, I thought I’d give some basic examples of how I’m using IFTTT.</p>

<p>She covers linking home devices, getting notifications with certain triggers, and a few other examples.</p>
