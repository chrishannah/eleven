title: I’ve Turned My Notifications Off
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown"><!-- link[https://medium.com/@chrishannah/ive-turned-my-notifications-off-bb1627e4a4df?source=linkShare-e436fad72050-1468768494] --></p>
<p>I wrote a piece/rant about notifications and how I deal with emails over on <a href="https://medium.com/@chrishannah/ive-turned-my-notifications-off-bb1627e4a4df?source=linkShare-e436fad72050-1468768494">Medium</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a while now, I’ve been slowly turning off notifications on my devices, but today I made the decision to switch off my email notifications as well.</p>
<p>It all comes down to my growing need to focus.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s about a 7 minute read, so you may want to put it aside for when you have time. But I hope I can change your mind about how I (and maybe you in the future) deal with notifications.</p>
