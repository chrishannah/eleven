title: My Home Screen on MacSparky
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown"><!-- link[http://macsparky.com/blog/2016/7/home-screens-christopher-hannah] --></p>
<p>I was asked by David Sparks recently if I would like to do a Home Screen feature for MacSparky, and I couldn&#8217;t turn it down!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This weekâ€™s home screen features Christopher Hannah (Website) (Twitter). Christopher developed my favorite Wikipedia app for the Mac, Qwiki. Qwiki puts Wikipedia in my search bar and I use it all the time. You should check it out. So Christopher, show us your home screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check it out on <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2016/7/home-screens-christopher-hannah">MacSparky</a>!</p>
