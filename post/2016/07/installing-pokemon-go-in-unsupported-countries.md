title: Installing Pokémon GO in Unsupported Countries
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard about Pokémon GO yet, then you&#8217;ve clearly been living under a very heavy rock, so <a href="http://pokemongo.com">check it out <strong>now</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The main restriction with Pokémon GO at the minute, is the inability to download it in certain countries. At the time of me writing this, it&#8217;s only available in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. So as I&#8217;m in the UK, I can&#8217;t <em>officially</em> download it from the App Store.</p>
<p>Unless, I was <em>&#8220;american&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>So the way I got around it was to go to <a href="appleid.apple.com">appleid.apple.com</a>, and create a new Apple ID which was based in the U.S. You can get a random U.S. address from <a href="http://www.fakeaddressgenerator.com/World/us_address_generator">this generator</a>, which will then let you create an account.</p>
<p>Then you will have to go to the App Store app, then at the bottom of your screen, tap on your current Apple ID and choose Sign Out.</p>
<p>Then sign in with your newly created U.S. Apple ID, it will prompt you to change to the U.S. App Store, which you can confirm.</p>
<p>Once that&#8217;s done you can download Pokémon GO simply by searching and finding it on the App Store, and because it&#8217;s free you won&#8217;t need any payment details on the account.</p>
<p>When the App is installed, you can then sign out of this account in the App Store, and sign back in to your real account.</p>
<p>Then open up Pokémon GO, and start capturing!</p>
