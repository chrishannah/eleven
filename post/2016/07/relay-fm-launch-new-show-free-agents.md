title: Relay FM Launch New Show "Free Agents"
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown"><!-- link[http://www.extras.relay.fm/blog/2016/7/26/introducing-free-agents] --></p>
<p>Relay FM have launched <em>another</em> great show, where <a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell">Jason Snell</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MacSparky">David Sparks</a> talk about how they became independent.</p>
<p>From the Relay FM blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year at WWDC, I had tea with Myke, Jason Snell and David Sparks.</p>
<p>At the time, I was on the fence about leaving my job to work on Relay FM full-time. It made sense on paper, but I was nervous about taking my fate into my own hands.</p>
<p>All three of them were already independent, and were very open about the challenges and rewards that working for yourself brings. (I think they&#8217;ll admit there was a little peer pressure going on to, but that&#8217;s beside the point.)</p>
<p>Today, Jason and David are launching a new fortnightly podcast named Free Agents. It&#8217;s all about work, and while they are both self-employed, the topics on Free Agents are applicable to all sorts of people. &#8211; <a href="http://www.extras.relay.fm/blog/2016/7/26/introducing-free-agents">Relay FM Extras</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of both what Jason and David do for their blogs, Six Colors, and MacSparky. So I&#8217;m really looking forward to hear everything they have to say about going independent, and any tips they have for the rest of us!</p>
<p>Anyway, the first episode is titled &quot;The Temptation of Yes&quot;, where they discuss the problems when saying Yes too much, and also how to narrow your scope when it comes to work.</p>
<p>You can find more about Free Agents, and the first episode on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/freeagents/1">Relay FM</a>. There&#8217;s also links to follow them on Twitter, and also on your favourite podcast app.</p>
