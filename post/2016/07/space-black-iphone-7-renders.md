title: Space Black iPhone 7 Renders

<p><!-- link[http://9to5mac.com/2016/06/30/space-black-iphone-7-images-no-headphone-jack/] --></p>
<p>9To5Mac have shared a <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2016/06/30/space-black-iphone-7-images-no-headphone-jack/">few 3D renders</a> of what a potential iPhone 7 would look like in Space Black. This comes after the previous rumours about a Deep Blue colour being added, but the same source has since reported that <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2016/06/27/iphone-7-space-black-not-deep-blue/">it was mistaken for a darker grey/black option</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The renders show an iPhone 7 in a dark, Space Black colour option. The antenna lines have also been redesigned in the renders, as has been rumoured will happen, while the camera module is also larger.</p></blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love the idea of having at least a near-black iPhone again, Space Grey just isn&#8217;t dark enough for me. It also adds more reason for a dark theme in iOS!</p>
<p>I also wish that this Space Black colour (if it would be called that), be added to their range of MacBooks, as I&#8217;m a strong admirer of the BlackBook.</p>
<p>The renders were done by Martin Hajek, and you can <a href="http://www.martinhajek.com/black-is-the-new-silver/">find loads more on his blog</a>.</p>
