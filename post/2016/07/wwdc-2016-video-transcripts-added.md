title: WWDC 2016 Video Transcripts Added
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown"><!-- link[https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=07082016a] --></p>
<p>Apple have now added the transcripts for all of the WWDC videos from this years event.  What&#8217;s more, is that all of these transcripts are searchable!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take advantage of transcripts to quickly discover and share information presented in WWDC16 videos. You can search by keyword, see all instances where the keyword is mentioned in the video, go straight to the time it was mentioned, and even share a link to that specific time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So just head over to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2016/">WWDC 2016 website</a>, to watch some of the videos, and the Transcript option is directly below the video.</p>
