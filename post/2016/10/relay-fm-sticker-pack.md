<p>As many of you will already know, Relay FM is home to a whole bunch of awesome podcasts, and people!</p>
<p>So it only makes sense that they bring some of the humour, artwork, and personality to your devices via iMessage Stickers!</p>
<blockquote><p>When considering the next update to our app, we didn&#8217;t have to look any further than Myke&#8217;s sticker-covered laptop and iPads.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>You can now cover your iMessage conversations with artwork inspired by your favourite Relay FM podcasts. Bringing jokes from the shows into your conversations is easy as a tap and drag on your iPhone or iPad. &#8211; <a href="http://www.extras.relay.fm/blog/2016/10/17/relay-fm-for-ios-update-adds-imessage-stickers">Relay FM Extras</a></p></blockquote>
<p>So in the latest version of their app, you get 40 stickers, which includes things like #mykewasright, and the Viticci Seal of Quality. Some of them have cool animations as well!</p>
<p>So if you already have the Relay FM app, the stickers will be in your Messages app already, otherwise <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/relay-fm/id1044683556?ign-mpt=uo%253D4&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=website&amp;mt=8">download it from the App Store for free!</a></p>
<p><em>P.S. More Relay FM Sticker Packs are also on their way!</em></p>
