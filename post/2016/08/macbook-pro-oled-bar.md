<p>Stephen Hackett <a href="https://512pixels.net/2016/08/burning-oled-questions/">has written his thoughts on the rumoured OLED touch bar</a>, which could be replacing the function keys of the next line of MacBook Pros.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The iPhone’s solution was to get rid of all of these plastic buttons, and make the entire experience — keyboard and all — take place in software running on a touchscreen.</p>
<p>I think this flexibility has a lot to do with what Apple is up to with this probably-new MacBook Pro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He puts forward some reasonable concerns, and it&#8217;s a point of view I haven&#8217;t seen from anyone else.</p>
