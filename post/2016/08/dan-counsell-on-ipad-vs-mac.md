<p>The problem with the iPad is both hardware and software related. Anything work related you can do on an iPad can, in most cases be done faster on a Mac. No question. &#8211; <a href="https://www.dancounsell.com/the-problem-with-ipad-and-why-its-not-a-mac-replacement/">Dan Counsell</a></p>

<p>This is probably the most common idea behind a the majority of iPad articles, whether it can truly be a device that replaces your Mac.</p>
<p>Well Dan Counsell (Founder of RealMac Software), has <a href="https://www.dancounsell.com/the-problem-with-ipad-and-why-its-not-a-mac-replacement/">written his thoughts on it</a>, and I thought it was worth sharing.</p>
