title: Watching The Perseids
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Tonight I watched some of the Perseids Meteor Shower in my back garden, and I just want to share my experience. Just in case you didn’t know, the Perseids are a meteor shower which typically appear in August. If you want to learn more then I’d recommend reading <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-33850710">this BBC article</a> for starters. Although I didn’t have the best viewing conditions (it was a bit cloudy), I managed to watch a few meteors fly past, and generally see a lot of stars.</p>
<h1 id="music">Music</h1>
<p>I couldn’t do this in silence, so I consulted Apple Music. I found a very apt selection in the “Being Outdoors” section of their activity playlists, I listened to one called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/playlist/underneath-the-stars/idpl.cd1e46899e31421285d7e655bac51cbd">“Under the Stars”</a>. I generally found the music to be okay, but my attention was mainly on the stars. One song I did like was <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/album/ladies-gentlemen-we-are-floating/id338527162?i=338527216&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;mt=1&amp;app=music">“Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space” by Spiritualised</a>.</p>
<h1 id="photography">Photography</h1>
<p>Of course I had to do some photography while I was there, I’m no professional though I do admit. I used my Canon EOS 1000d with a 50mm prime lens, pointing directly up from where I was laying. I used an app called DSLR Assistant for Mac, which is fantastic in my opinion. I didn’t spend too much time getting the perfect shot, as I was more focussed on seeing them with my own eyes. I haven’t edited the photos in any way at all, they are straight from my camera. <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49650552/Blog/img_01194.jpg">Here is a shot</a> where I actually captured part of the shower. And <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4qnjp97tznrfa37/perseid.mov">here is a 4 second video</a> of 60 different photos that I took. Just to be clear, the photo gets slightly orange at the end as a street light decided it was a good time to turn on. Hopefully, it still looks okay</p>
