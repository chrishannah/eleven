title: Serpentine - My Snake Clone
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>I created my first ever snake clone! It was a quick entry for Ludum Dare #34, just because I wanted to enter <em>something</em>, and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve never done before.</p>
<p>So I went with a basic 4 colour palette, in the style of old GameBoy games. And also super simple graphics, so everything is square blocks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my first SpriteKit game as well which is nice, because I&#8217;ve been meaning to actually use it for a while. So hopefully I use it again soon!</p>
<p>Here is what the game looks like:<br />

<p>You can view the <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&amp;uid=7468">Ludum Dare entry page</a> for the competition version, or if you want the more updated version then check out <a href="http://cryptix.itch.io/serpentine">Serpentine on itch.io</a>. I&#8217;ll probably add a bit more to Serpentine in the future, so if you want any updates it&#8217;s probably best to follow me on twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/chrishannah">@chrishannah</a>.</p>
