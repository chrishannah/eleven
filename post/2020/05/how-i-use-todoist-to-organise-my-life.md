title: How I Use Todoist To Organise My Life
---

<p><a href="https://gr36.com/todoist-organise-my-life/">Greg Morris, on how he uses Todoist</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So. No apologies here, but I ripped off this idea directly from Matt Birchler’s write-up <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/how-i-use-things-3-to-organize-my-life/">on his Things setup</a>. Even though he is a strong believer in the ability of Things, and also everyone <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1261314996048363521">in the replies</a> seems to think the <a href="https://gr36.com/todoist-my-new-app-to-get-things-done/">Todoist</a> design is trash, I think very much that we have the same outlook on GTD. The basis of this revolves around “offloading your brain” so you can focus on other things.</p>
<p>I never set levels of tasks that I HAVE to get done each day, but I DO aim to get 3 main things ticked off each working day. This set up has been how I get everything done daily and also why I forget loads of meaningless stuff. This isn’t a GTD set up, but it’s my set up and it all starts with the Inbox.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Greg&#8217;s use of Todoist really fascinates me. He combines a general inbox, with the daily task of sorting them, and on top of that, it looks like he has a very intentional structure. Which is the part that I like the most because if you can understand why someone did something, it&#8217;s much easier to see if you can use that information to improve upon something of your own.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a ton of stuff that Greg talks about, that I just didn&#8217;t know was possible in Todoist. For example, you can link to emails from an item, which I imagine would be very handy, and also the new Upcoming screen looks like it would be very beneficial.</p>

<p>Not long after sharing his Todoist setup, Greg also wrote another post, &#8220;<a href="https://gr36.com/cracking-todoist-code/">Cracking the Todoist Code</a>&#8220;, where he goes over the natural language support, and how you can bring it all together:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since sharing my Todoist set up and how I get things done loads of people have given me some ideas and shared their experience. One of which I wanted to try to help out with, and that is the natural language input. This feels amazingly natural to me, but for some feels like a bit of a code — so let’s crack it together.</p>
