title: Trading Standards Squad Targets Anti-5G USB Stick
---

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52810220">Rory Cellan-Jones, writing for BBC News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trading Standards officers are seeking to halt sales of a device that has been claimed to offer protection against the supposed dangers of 5G via use of quantum technology.</p>
<p>Cyber-security experts say the £339 5GBioShield appears to no more than a basic USB drive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This story is incredible in so many ways.</p>
<p>Especially when you get to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each of these USB keys costs £339.60 including VAT, though there is a special offer of three for £958.80.</p>
<p>But, at first sight, it seems to be just that &#8211; a USB key, with just 128MB of storage.</p>
<p>&#8220;So what&#8217;s different between it and a virtually identical &#8216;crystal&#8217; USB key available from various suppliers in Shenzhen, China, for around £5 per key?&#8221; asks Ken Munro, whose company, Pen Test Partners, specialises in taking apart consumer electronic products to spot security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>And the answer appears to be a circular sticker.</p>
