title: The New Share Extension in Tot
---

<p><a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2020/05/toys-for-tot/">Craig Hockenberry, writing at the Iconfactory blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re happy to announce a new version of Tot with some features frequently requested by the app’s legion of fans.</p>
<p>The main focus of today’s release are system extensions that allow Tot to co-exist with other apps. To this end, we’ve added a Sharing extension for both iOS and macOS. Additionally, there’s also a widget for iOS that lets you quickly access any of Tot’s dots. Like everything else in Tot, attention was paid to minimizing friction, allowing information to be collected as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>I personally use the macOS version of Tot, quite heavily actually. And I think this share extension will be perfect when I quickly want to send text to a note.</p>
<p>It also makes me want to download the iOS app, because that probably has to be the best looking share extension I&#8217;ve ever seen. It does seem pricy for a simple note app, and that is the main reason why I haven&#8217;t bought it. But now I&#8217;m using the macOS version more, both of them as a package are starting to look like a good deal to me.</p>
