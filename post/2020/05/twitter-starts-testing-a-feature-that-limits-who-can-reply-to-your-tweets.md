title: Twitter Starts Testing a Feature That Limits Who Can Reply to Your Tweets

<p><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/testing-new-conversation-settings.html">Suzanne Xie, writing at the Twitter Product Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twitter is where you go to see and talk about whatâ€™s happening. But sometimes, unwanted replies make it hard to have meaningful conversations. (Ahem, <a href="https://twitter.com/agirlcalledlina/status/1261991391204446210">reply guys</a>.) Since last year, weâ€™ve been working to give people more control over their conversations starting with <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1197551185894559744">the ability to hide replies</a>. We also began trying out new ways to start conversations with casual, <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBrasil/status/1235248713125285895">fleeting thoughts</a>. And now, weâ€™re testing new settings that let you choose who can reply to your Tweet and join your conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twitter also <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1263145271946551300">posted a short video</a> showing off how the feature would work:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Testing, testing&#8230;</p>
<p>A new way to have a convo with exactly who you want. Weâ€™re starting with a small % globally, so keep your ðŸ‘€ out to see it in action. <a href="https://t.co/pV53mvjAVT">pic.twitter.com/pV53mvjAVT</a></p>

<p>So tweets will (for the small percentage of users that can access the feature) have three options regarding who can reply: everyone, only people you follow, or only people you mention in the tweet. That seems to make sense, and they are probably the most common options you&#8217;d want if you wanted to limit replies.</p>
<p>It does seem slightly odd though, in that you would be able to have a public Twitter profile that no-one can reply to. However, as soon as you mention someone in a tweet, they can reply, since that&#8217;s allowed on all three options. SO at least you won&#8217;t be able to troll people, and at the same time stop them from replying.</p>
<p>Well, no matter happens with this idea, I&#8217;m personally all for Twitter experimenting with features such as this. And also the mentioned &#8220;fleeting tweets&#8221; idea, that interesting me as well. Surely one&#8217;s going to stick eventually?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Since seeing <a href="https://twitter.com/twitter/status/1263213348000325633?s=21">a thread between Twitter and NASA</a>, the benefits of this feature have clicked my head. Since you&#8217;ll be able to limit who replies to each tweet, your threads can stay perfectly clean!</p>
