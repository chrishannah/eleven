title: BBC Launches Tool for Joint Lockdown Viewing
---

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52723573">BBC News &#8211; Entertainment &amp; Arts</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been wishing you could enjoy a TV or radio show with friends during lockdown, the BBC is trialling a tool to allow just that.</p>
<p>BBC Together lets you watch or listen to content from BBC iPlayer, Sounds, Bitesize, News and Sport in sync with other people using different devices.</p>
<p>It is available through the BBC&#8217;s experimental website Taster.</p>
<p>BBC R&amp;D&#8217;s Dr Libby Miller said being separate &#8220;doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t enjoy great programmes with our friends&#8221;.</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;We wanted to see if technology could bring people together to watch and listen to BBC shows remotely as a shared experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;host&#8221; of the group can send a link from the BBC Together site, then control when to play and pause so everyone sees the same thing at the same time. A maximum number of 50 people can join.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard about this type of platform before, where groups of people in different locations can watch videos or listen to music together. So it&#8217;s good to see BBC experimenting with adding support directly inside iPlayer.</p>
