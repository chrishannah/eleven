title: Six Shortcuts Livestreams I’ve Done in May
---

<p><a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/shortcuts-live_2020-05/">Matthew Cassinelli</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the start of May, I’ve streamed with the developers of Charty, Timery, and LaunchCuts (plus talked to the Data Jar developer), plus in the process reached out for more streams in the form of Chris Lawley showing my editing videos on iPad with LumaFusion, I showed Matt Cox the basics of shortcuts over an hour, and I had the pleasure of Jason Snell walking me through one of his Charty shortcuts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matthew has created quite a collection of videos with these live streams. I&#8217;ve just watched the Charty and LumaFusion video so far, and although I don&#8217;t use these apps myself, I still found them interesting. I&#8217;m definitely going to watch the rest!</p>
