title: Can You Guess All 151 Pokémon?
---

<p>On little YouTube adventure I had this afternoon, I came across a video of someone trying to guess all of the 151 original Pokémon. To be honest, the idea of watching someone do this themselves sounded absolutely boring. But I wanted to try and do it myself. It’s my favourite generation of Pokémon, so I thought I’d know it quite well, although I haven’t played it in quite some time (Even though I really should get back to playing Pokemon Sword).</p>
<p>Well, after the first twenty minutes, I’d guessed around 100 of them. I thought that was impressive, until it took about ten more minutes to guess the next twenty Pokémon. But by that point my mind went completely blank. So my progress so far is 120 Pokémon in 30 minutes, although I haven’t closed the tab, so I <em>may</em> try and complete it later.</p>
<p>If you want to try it yourself, you can <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/pokemon">find the quiz on Sporcle</a>, which I think has a really good format for online quizzes. It’s just a single text field where you constantly type guesses, and if you get one correct, the text is cleared, and the relevant field is populated. It’s pretty fun.</p>

<p>While I was on Sporcle, I found a few more quizzes to try. So here they are, along with my score:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/europe">Name the countries of Europe</a> &#8211; 34/47</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/kfastic/through-the-kaleidoscope-premier-league">Name the all-time Premier League clubs from their logos as shown through a kaleidoscope?</a> &#8211; 19/25</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/needapausebutton/tabula-sporcliada-potteramus">Can you name (or deduce) the Harry Potter characters represented by the symbols on this &#8216;periodic table&#8217; representation?</a> &#8211; Around 60/132 (I’m going to try this again when I have more time).</li>
</ul>
