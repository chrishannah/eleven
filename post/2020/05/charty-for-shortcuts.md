title: Charty for Shortcuts
---

<p>I came across <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/charty-for-shortcuts/id1494386093">Charty</a> recently on Twitter, and it looks like it&#8217;s going to be a great addition to the growing collection of apps that are designed to slot directly into the Shortcuts app.</p>
<p>After playing around with it, I was going to write an in-depth article on what I thought about it, but instead I&#8217;ve found three articles that I think explain it really well. And they also include examples so you can see what type of charts you can create.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of those apps that at first you dismiss, but when actually looking around the app you realise just how helpful it can be. That&#8217;s because developer Rodrigo Araújo has thought about almost every aspect of the app. Building on the success of his first app ChartStat he aims to make it easy for everyone to visualise any kind of data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Making charts by hand is labor intensive. But it gets easier if you can make the chart one time and just update the data as new numbers flow in. If that sounds like a job for user automation, you’re singing my tune—and I’m happy to report that the new app Charty is built to add charting capabilities to the iOS Shortcuts app.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are lots of Shortcuts actions and routines that generate data and could easily benefit from a simple bar graph or pie chart to provide useful insights more quickly and effectively. One example that comes to mind is graphing time-tracking data from Toggl once every week, let’s say, to see what tasks or projects you’ve been the most busy with — all without having to open the unpleasant Toggl app or the clunky web client from your iOS device. Charty is the perfect companion for those who accumulate lots of meta-data about their lives and want to frequently revisit and reassess the areas they are seeking to improve — whether that be calories burned, books read, or tasks completed, Charty plugs right into your existing Shortcuts routines and allows you to quickly turn those datasets into easily-digestible graphics. The option to create default chart format settings and custom “Export Profiles” of chart size, font size, and background color both help to add consistency in how your charts are formatted before saving them for yourself or sharing with the world.</p>
