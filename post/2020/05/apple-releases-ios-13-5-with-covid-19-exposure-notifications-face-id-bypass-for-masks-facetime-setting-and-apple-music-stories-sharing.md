<blockquote>
<p>Today Apple released what is essentially a COVID-19 update for iPhones. iOS 13.5 includes several features specifically designed for our current global pandemic, including exposure notifications, mask detection for bypassing Face ID, and a new prominence setting for FaceTime, along with a nice new Apple Music sharing feature optimized for Instagram Stories. With WWDC and iOS 14â€™s reveal only a month away, this is likely the last major update to the current OS release cycle.</p>

<p>This update is no doubt going to be known as the COVID-19 update, simply because of the exposure notifications. But seeing as we don&#8217;t have an app that supports that currently here in the UK, it&#8217;s really just the &#8220;Apple Music x Instagram&#8221; update for us. Which is totally fine with me. Because I really like how it&#8217;s been done, and it looks great!</p>
