title: Dad Builds Secret Harry Potter Street in Daughter's Wardrobe

[From BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-berkshire-54753502):

The dad spent multiple months putting this together. I can imagine it taking quite a lot of effort, with the planning and construction. And it looks like it's been done really well, the detail on the shop fronts are really good.

But as impressive as it is, it stil didn't stop me thinking that the child will probably get bored of it soon, or possibly even outgrow it, seeing as it looks like a tight space.

All I'm saying is, as much as this is a cool idea, I'm not doing it for any future kids I have!
