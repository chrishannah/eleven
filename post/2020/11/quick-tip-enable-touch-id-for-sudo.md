> My new MacBook Air is proving to be all that I’d hoped, and it’s not just because of the fancy new M1 processors. Since I’m coming from a 2014 MacBook, I’m reaping the benefits of all the other advancements Apple has made to its laptop line in the intervening years, and prime among those is the incorporation of Touch ID: I’ve already enabled it for 1Password (what a lifesaver) and, thanks to a tip from [Twitter follower Josef](https://twitter.com/ifixcz/status/1329127972029263872?s=20), I can bring it to one of my other favorite places: the command line.

Such a great tip. I wonder why it's not more easily available?
