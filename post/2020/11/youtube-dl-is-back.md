title: youtube-dl Is Back
---

Good news! The [youtube-dl repository](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) is now back up on GitHub. If you weren't aware, it was removed due to the [RIAA issued a DMCA takedown notice](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md).

As much as I agreed that the use of youtube-dl spanned much further than simply downloading videos from YouTube, I don't think the name exactly helps.

If you're wondering what they had to change to bring youtube-dl back, then you'll be surprised. They simply [removed any uses of RIAA member videos from the tests](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/commit/1fb034d029c8b7feafe45f64e6a0808663ad315e). The fact that this fixed the issue, makes the whole ordeal seem a little childish to me.

But who cares, it's back.
