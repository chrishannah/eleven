title: Why Jurassic Park Looks Better Than Its Sequels
---

<p>I just come across a video by Jonathan Burdett, a YouTuber that predominately creates video essays on blockbuster films for his channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcddcRNcQfVwCMmvV2QWf8Q/about">Films&amp;Stuff</a>. In the video I watched, he talked about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKALxKbjOaE">the original Jurassic Park movie and how it looks better than the sequels</a>.</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BKALxKbjOaE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>
<p>As you&#8217;d expect, it comes down to various factors. However, I found it curious as to why the sequels weren&#8217;t at the same level. I would think that the sequels would build on the skills learned from the first movie, but clearly there was something missing.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say they all the sequels are bad. But, when I think about it, if I had to rank all 5 current films, there probably would be a downward trend. As a rough estimate, if I could give each film a score out of 10, this is what it would look like:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Film</th>
<th>Rank (0-10)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Jurassic Park</td>
<td>9&#46;5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</td>
<td>8&#46;5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jurassic Park III</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jurassic World</td>
<td>6&#46;5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I like all of them. But the first three are massively better than the Jurassic World films. I&#8217;m still holding out for Jurassic World: Dominion though. Because that looks like it&#8217;s going to explore a whole new perspective, not just the same idea of a dinosaur park being made, then turning out to be a bad idea.</p>
