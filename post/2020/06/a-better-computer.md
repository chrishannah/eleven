<p>Matt Birchler, <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/a-better-computer/">introducing his new YouTube channel</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today I&#8217;m excited to introduce my new YouTube channel, A Better Computer. This channel will be devoted to helping you make the computer in front of you, whether it be an iPhone, and iPad, or PC, better than it was before; we want to make it a better computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not just <em>another</em> tech YouTube channel though, the idea is that the videos will be short, but highly produced, and have a very limited scope. For example, alongside the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGYdWR8QUYn88lG0PBeJQ_g">trailer for the channel</a>, there are already three great videos to watch:</p>

<p>My favourite so far has to be the most recent one, about making tasks smaller in order to get more done. Since this is something I&#8217;ve been doing myself for a while, and I&#8217;ve always found it to be a very effective way to get big chunks of work done. Because for me personally, while I <em>want</em> to complete big tasks, the idea of them usually puts me off. But if I split the one big task into various small tasks that can be individually actioned, then it&#8217;s so much easier to make progress, and eventually complete it.</p>
<p>As you can tell, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGYdWR8QUYn88lG0PBeJQ_g">A Better Computer</a> is going to be one great YouTube channel, so I definitely recommend subscribing.</p>
