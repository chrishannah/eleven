title: Back Tapping on iOS 14
---

<p>I haven&#8217;t had time to go through a lot of WWDC content just yet (I&#8217;m currently spending most of my time laying a new floor in my house), but I did install iOS 14 and macOS 11 to my devices essentially as soon as they were available. I&#8217;m really impressed with all the updates this year, and I&#8217;ll end up writing about the things I really enjoy. But for now, the feature I love the most is Back Tap.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an accessibility feature at the moment, found in Settings → Accessibility → Touch → Back Tap. And it lets you assign actions to a double or triple-tap on the back of your iPhone. For example, you could double-tap the back of your iPhone to lock it, or you could take a screenshot. There are quite a lot of possibilities. There are currently 14 general actions, 7 accessibility actions, and 2 scroll gestures to choose from. That&#8217;s not including the fact that you can also choose a custom shortcut to run as an action.</p>

<p>What intrigues me is how it actually works. I imagine it&#8217;s detecting the shake, and not necessarily a &#8220;tap&#8221;. But it&#8217;s still interesting that a new feature was added that simply makes use of current hardware in a different way.</p>
<p>When I was trying to work out what actions I wanted to assign to my iPhone, I was trying to think of things I want to perform quickly, or without a delay.</p>
<p>The first was obvious, opening the camera. There are tons of times where I just want to quickly take a photo of something, usually, it&#8217;s my cat being weird, so that&#8217;s definitely going to be useful. There&#8217;s no standard open app action, but as you can run a Shortcut as an action, I made a simple one that just launches the camera app.</p>
<p>The second one took a bit more time to think of, but I settled on creating a tweet. This had to be a shortcut as well, but it was just as simple. One action that creates a new tweet in the Twitter app.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/534fee79c5584e1386d0904561ffbecb">Create New Tweet Shortcut</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So I can double-tap the back of my phone to open the camera and triple-tap it to start writing a tweet. Who would have thought that would be possible with just a software update?</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s currently hidden as an accessibility feature, I can imagine this being pretty popular. Certainly, enough for it to make its way to becoming a &#8220;real&#8221; feature.</p>
