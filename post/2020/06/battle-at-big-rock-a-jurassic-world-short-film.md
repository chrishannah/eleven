title: 'Battle at Big Rock: A Jurassic World Short  Film'
---

<p>I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World:_Fallen_Kingdom">Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</a> today, seeing as it&#8217;s now <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80228280">on Netflix</a>. After it finished, I immediately searched online to see if there were any sequels being planned, or if I&#8217;ve just missed a release entirely.</p>
<p>Well, of course, there is a sequel being planned for release in 2021, I just forgot about it. It&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World:_Dominion">Jurassic World: Dominion</a>. So nothing I could watch right now.</p>
<p>But I did noticed something new on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park">Jurassic Park Wikipedia page</a>. Last year, a short film was released called &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_at_Big_Rock">Battle at Big Rock</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>It is a <em>very</em> short film. All together, including credits, it&#8217;s just over 10 minutes. However, I see it more as a glimpse into what we will expect to see in Dominion. Especially as it was directed by Colin Trevorrow, and written by Trevorrow and Emily Carmichael, and they are also the director and writers of Dominion.</p>
<p>The film is set after Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, and as you may remember, that ends with the dinosaurs ending up on the US mainland. Which is something that we&#8217;ll have to adjust to seeing, in future films<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But for now, all we&#8217;ve got is Battle at Big Rock, and luckily <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7kbVvpOGdQ">it&#8217;s on YouTube</a>:</p>
