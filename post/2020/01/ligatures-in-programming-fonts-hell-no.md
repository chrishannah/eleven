title: 'Ligatures in Programming Fonts: Hell No'
---

<p>Matthew Butterick, <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/ligatures-in-programming-fonts-hell-no.html">on the use of ligatures</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Ligatures in programming fonts—a misguided trend I was hoping would collapse under its own illogic. But it persists. Let me save you some&nbsp;time—</p>
<p>Ligatures in programming fonts are a terrible&nbsp;idea.</p>
<p>And not because I’m a purist or a grump. (Some days, but not today.) Programming code has special semantic considerations. Ligatures in programming fonts are likely to either misrepresent the meaning of the code, or cause miscues among readers. So in the end, even if they’re cute, the risk of error isn’t worth&nbsp;it.</p></blockquote>
<p>His post certainly opened my mind up to the problems with ligatures in a programming font. It actually made me switch away from the new <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">monospaced typeface from JetBrains</a>, simply because of its use of ligatures, 138 code-specific ligatures to be exact.</p>
<p>Back to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/">SF Mono</a> it is.</p>
