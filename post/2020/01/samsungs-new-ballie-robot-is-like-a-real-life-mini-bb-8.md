title: Samsung’s New Ballie Robot Is Like a Real-Life Mini BB-8
---

<p>Jay Peters, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21054353/samsung-ballie-robot-ai-assistant-ces-2020">writing at The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Today, at Samsung’s keynote at CES, Samsung introduced Ballie, a small ball-shaped robot intended to help you around the house. Samsung says Ballie utilizes AI to be a security robot, a fitness assistant, a tool to help seniors connect with smart devices in their homes, and it can even be a friend to your kids and pets.</p>
<p>  In an onstage demo, Ballie followed Samsung consumer electronics division CEO H.S. Kim on the stage by rolling around, seemingly by using the camera to track Kim as he walked across the stage. Ballie also gave cute little robotic chimes in response to a couple of commands from Kim, and it even rolled right into Kim’s hands when he called for it.

<p>I <em>need</em> one.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care about it opening the blinds, turning on TVs, or anything. I want a little robot that can make whimsical noises, look remotely like a BB8, play with my cat, and do absolutely nothing else.</p>
<p>Where do I send my money?</p>
