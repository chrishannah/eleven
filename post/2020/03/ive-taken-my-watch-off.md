title: I've Taken My Watch Off
---

<p>I&#8217;ll start by saying, I haven&#8217;t worn my Apple Watch in about two weeks. There was no big decision when I stopped wearing it, but I&#8217;ve noticed that over the past month or so, I would just be less bothered about wearing it. So much so, the tan line on my wrist has near-enough disappeared.</p>
<p>I know it was about two weeks because that&#8217;s when my heart rate data has ended on the Health app. But it occurred regularly before that, where I would wake up and instantly grab my phone and watch. But I would sit down with a coffee, put my phone and my watch both on the side, and never pay any attention to my watch until it was time to put it on charge again.</p>
<p>My original lack of interest with the watch started I think when I wasn&#8217;t going to work. Because that&#8217;s probably the only time that I felt I needed constant access to everything. Whether it&#8217;s the time, the weather, access to music that&#8217;s playing from a device just in my pocket, or all the notifications that I would instantly dismiss.</p>
<p>Now when I think about what I can actually gain from the Apple Watch, I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m ever really going to wear it regularly again.</p>
<p>Here is a list of all the things I&#8217;ve ever done with an Apple Watch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the time.</li>
<li>Pause/Play/Skip music/podcast.</li>
<li>Track a workout. (Not a real workout, just small walks)</li>
<li>Checked the weather. (Not that it matters to me that much, my outfit doesn&#8217;t change all year-round)</li>
<li><a href="https://chrishannah.me/new-watches-strategy/">Tracked my sleep</a>. (It didn&#8217;t take long for this to stop)</li>
<li><a href="https://chrishannah.me/being-surprised-by-an-apple-watch-app/">Played a game called Field Day for a while</a>.</li>
<li>Triggered a few interactions with Pokémon GO.</li>
<li>Checked football scores.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s about all I&#8217;ve ever done.</p>
<p>Now for what I use my watch for, just before I started to not wear it as often:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to think I don&#8217;t need a smart watch anymore.</p>
<p>No music/podcasts are being controlled on the watch anymore, because I have AirPods that can do that. I don&#8217;t track workouts because they were never real workouts anyway. I don&#8217;t play Field Day or Pokémon GO anymore. And if I want to check anything like the weather, football scores, text messages, I just take my phone out of my pocket.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started to actually like not having my wrist being the interface between myself and the internet. And I&#8217;ve grown tired about being notified about things that I just don&#8217;t care about.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll eventually put my watch back on charge and then I can see if there is any remaining use for it. But for now I&#8217;ll be keeping it off. Maybe I&#8217;ll even think about buying an analogue watch.</p>
