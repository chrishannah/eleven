<blockquote>
<p>I’m reminded of Dieter Rams’ 10th principle of good design: Good design is as little design as possible. The vibe I get from many tech YouTube videos, and this one in particular, is the exact opposite. Why is Android better? Because it has more X and the hardware comes in Y variants. So many arguments involve the word “more” but so few involve the word “better” which saddens me.</p>

<p>Precisely this. Too many times I hear Android being better than iOS because it has “more” of something. Sure, it’s bound to be better at certain things than iOS, but that’s not what typically gets talked about.</p>
