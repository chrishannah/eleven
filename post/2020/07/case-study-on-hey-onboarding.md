title: A Case Study on HEY Email's Onboarding
---

<p>I just came across a really <a href="https://growth.design/case-studies/hey-user-onboarding/">fun and interactive case study about HEY Email</a>. It&#8217;s basically a run through of the user onboarding with an eye on the UX.</p>
<p>After going through the case study, it certainly isn&#8217;t a perfect experience. But I still feel like I need to check out HEY at some point. Even just to see what everyone is on about. Although I do already get the feeling that while I may like the idea, it&#8217;s not done in the right way for me.</p>
<p>These are of course preemptive, but I&#8217;ve got three reasons why I probably won&#8217;t like HEY:</p>
<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s currently no support for custom domains. So I&#8217;d be stuck with another email address.</li>
<li>You have to use their own email clients. Which may be fine at the start, but I can&#8217;t imagine I&#8217;ll be wanting to use the HEY email client for the rest of my life.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about paying for an email service. Especially as everything is so closed down. If I go all in on HEY, then after a year I decide to quit, then I&#8217;ve got to go through the process of switching everything to a new address.</li>
</ul>
