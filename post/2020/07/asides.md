<p>There are times where I want to write a quick post here on my blog, but either it can be a quick thought, small review, or something that just doesn&#8217;t fit within the typical content on this blog. Last year I used to write a lot of this stuff on Micro.blog, but recently I&#8217;ve been wanting to move it here, where I can truly say I own my content.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a category for &#8220;micro posts&#8221; on this blog for quite a while now, although it&#8217;s not always been very visible. As it stands it&#8217;s mostly a collection of Micro.blog posts, around 6 months of me keeping a journal, and some photos. But what I want it to turn into is a place where I write more informally, which is what I&#8217;m going to do! So if that sounds like something that interests you, check out <a href="https://chrishannah.me/category/asides/">the asides section</a>. If you&#8217;re really like it, then feel free to <a href="https://chrishannah.me/category/asides/feed">subscribe via RSS</a>.</p>
<p>This decision may change in the future, but as of right now, this new section will be separated from the main content on the blog. As in posts won&#8217;t appear in the main RSS feed or on the homepage. It certainly feels right to have them excluded from the RSS feed because I appreciate not everyone will want this extra level of commentary from me. But I&#8217;m open to the idea to eventually have them somehow fit on to the main section on the website. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>
