> Earlier this year, [**WordPress**](https://crunchbase.com/organization/wordpress) .com [introduced](https://wordpress.com/blog/2020/07/15/unroll-your-twitter-threads-into-wordpress/) an easier way to post your Twitter threads, also known as tweetstorms, to your blog with the introduction of “unroll” option for [**Twitter**](https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter)  embeds. Today, the company is addressing the flip side of tweetstorm publication — it’s [making it possible](https://wordpress.com/blog/2020/10/13/a-new-way-to-publish-your-blog-posts-simultaneously-as-twitter-threads/) to turn your existing WordPress blog post into a tweetstorm with just a couple of clicks.The new feature will allow you to tweet out every word of your post, as well as the accompanying images and videos, the company says. These will be automatically inserted into the thread where they belong alongside your text.

My immediate reaction when I first saw the headline, was "oh my god this is terrible". But after reading the article, I think it actually makes some sense for the world we live in right now.

As much as I dislike the situation, a lot more people read Twitter than they read blog posts. So in regard to your content being accessible, it's great. I still feel it moves away from content having a canonical place on the internet, but that could just be the idealist in me.

One part of me thinks that is a feature that will please some people, but I wouldn't use it for my own blog. Another part of me deep down, wants Ghost to add something similar so I can try it out.
