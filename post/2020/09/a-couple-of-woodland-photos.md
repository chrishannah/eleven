title: A Couple of Woodland Photos
---

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to get better at photography recently, by watching a ton of YouTube videos mainly by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkJld-AoXurbT2jDnfM8qiA">Nigel Danson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThomasHeatonPhoto">Thomas Heaton</a>, and a ton more. There&#8217;s one thing that I notice all photographers go back to, and it&#8217;s that simply going out with your camera, is the best thing you can do to improve your photography skills.</p>
<p>So just over a week ago, I decided I would wake up just before sunrise, and go for a walk around where I live. I walked through a few wooded areas, down near a river, and through some generally green areas. The environment wasn&#8217;t on my side for the shots I was trying to get, as in I found a few compositions in a woodland where some mist would have really added depth, and by the river, there was a shot I could have got if I had more direct sun instead of it being hidden by clouds.</p>
<p>However, on the walk back to my house, I did discover that there is a small area of &#8220;woodland&#8221; essentially behind my house. I just never noticed it, because it&#8217;s out of the way, and hidden between a load of houses. But anyway, even with lighting that I didn&#8217;t like that much, I think I got a two shots that I&#8217;m happy with.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve uploaded them to various places &#8211; <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/186342532@N04/with/50254362612/">Flickr</a>, <a href="https://500px.com/p/chrishannah?view=photos">500px</a>, and <a href="http://instagram.com/lordchrishannah/">Instagram</a>. <a href="https://500px.com/p/chrishannah?view=photos">500px</a> is something I&#8217;ve used for a while, so there&#8217;s a lot of old photos there, and to be honest I&#8217;m not happy with a lot of them. So I&#8217;m hoping that <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/186342532@N04/with/50254362612/">Flickr</a> will become my new canonical place for my photography, before I most likely decide to put them here somehow. And, I&#8217;m probably going to be uploading a lot of my favourite shots to my <a href="http://instagram.com/lordchrishannah/">Instagram</a> too.</p>
