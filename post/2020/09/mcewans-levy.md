<p>For a birthday present recently, I was given a collection of classic ales. The only problem was, I&#8217; not an ale drinker. I drink lager. And lots of it.</p>
<p>However, I decided with these 6 bottles, that I would give each of them an honest go and see how I liked each of them.</p>

<p>So to start off, I went with a bottle of McEwans Levy, which is a Scottish beer. It said it was light in taste, and half of my family is Scottish, so it made the moot sense to me to start with this.</p>
<p>I must admit though, that when I first opened the bottle, it had a really sudden bitterness, which put me off straight away. But I poured it into a glass, and the colour of it didn&#8217;t help either. But after I took the first sip, my opinion rapidly changed. It&#8217;s certainly got a prominent malt taste, which it turns out I think I like. But it&#8217;s certainly a decent beer. I&#8217;m not sure I would go out of my way to have one of these, but I&#8217;m definitely drinking the whole bottle right now.</p>
<p>I think I’ll class this as a &#8220;safe beer”, and give it a <strong>7/10</strong>.</p>
<p>Who knows which one I&#8217;ll be tasting next.</p>
