title: 'PaymentKit: How Apple Lets Some Air Out of this Pressure Cooker'
---

<p><a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/paymentkit-how-apple-lets-some-air-out-of-this-pressure-cooker/">Matt Birchler, on the improvements he wants to see regarding payments in apps</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply, I want Apple to allow third party payments in apps. This does not have to turn the App Store into some sort of hellscape where card details are stolen on the regular and no one wants to buy anything anymore because it’s so bad.</p>
<p>E-commerce has grown a ton over the last decade, and it’s grown almost as much in the past 6 months all over again. People buy things online all the time, and modern tools allow merchants to collect that data securely. I’d love to see that come to the App Store, but in ways that only Apple can do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like everything he proposes here, especially a &#8220;PaymentKit&#8221; API, which would allow some form of conformity to a standard, while offering a greater level of freedom to app developers. Mainly because other payment platforms would be able to offer their own options as SDKs to app developers, giving them and the end customers more choice.</p>
<p>Just adding this framework wouldn&#8217;t mean an immediate fix to the issue regarding payments inside apps. However, it would lay the groundwork needed for a more competitive marketplace. And with more competition, there will be an incentive to offer a better solution for developers and customers.</p>
