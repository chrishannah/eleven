title: Folding Phones
---

<p>I haven&#8217;t really been paying attention to the news around foldable phones, or been interested in any of the hype surrounding them. But this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc8DLi12Y-Q">“Fold, Flip, or Duo: why fold a phone?”</a>, Dieter Bohn did for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCddiUEpeqJcYeBxX1IVBKvQ">The Verge</a> at least provided me with some context on why people would actually want one.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t see myself ever wanting a foldable phone. But I&#8217;m slowly starting to agree that it could be a compelling product for a lot of people.</p>
