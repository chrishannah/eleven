Continuing on from the [McEwans Levy](https://chrishannah.me/mcewans-levy/) just over a week ago, I've been drinking another ale tonight from a collection I got as a present a while ago.

Tonight I gave the Hobgoblin Ruby a try. It's advertised as having a sweet caramel and fruity taste, with a mix of chocolate and crystal malts.

Since this is only the second time I've tried an ale before, my palate isn't that good. However, I definitely notice the fruity tones, and in general it tastes a bit rich. I think that could be the chocolatey flavour coming through, but it's not something I'm a big fan of.

I'd say that if the McLevys was a 7/10, I'd give this a **6/10**. I can drink it, and it's not that bad, but I wouldn't say it's that god either.
