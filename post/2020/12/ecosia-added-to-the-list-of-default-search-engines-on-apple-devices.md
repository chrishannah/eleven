title: Ecosia Added to the List of Default Search Engines on Apple Devices
---

<p>Apple has now added a fifth default Search engine option to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. And that new addition is <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/">Ecosia</a>.</p>

<p>Ecosia is a search engine that has been <a href="https://info.ecosia.org/what">produced to plant trees</a>. Not literally, but the profit from the search ads are used to plant trees, and therefore to help the environment.</p>

<p>I heard about Ecosia quite a few years ago, but it didn't seem to work that well for me. I've tried it again recently, and it seems to have improved a lot. So I'm going to be setting it as default on all of my devices to really try it out. For the simple reason that if I can get reasonable search results, then there really isn't a negative, only a positive effect of trees being planted.</p>

<p>To be honest, although Apple added DuckDuckGo to the list of default search engines, I didn't really expect them to add any more. DuckDuckGo just seemed like a privacy-focussed alternative to Google. </p>

<p>I wonder how many people will switch to Ecosia, and if Apple will add even more options in the future? Maybe they will make their own?</p>
