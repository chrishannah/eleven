title: Own Your Face
---

On todays episode of lunchtime YouTube, I discovered a fascinating [TEDx Talk by Robert Hoge on owning your face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxinUJcLGg). Not in the sense of physically owning it, but accepting yourself.

It's relatively short, only 16 minutes. But he talks quite deeply about beauty, perceived imperfections, and accepting what you look like.

I think there's a much bigger problem in society nowadays, where we tend to crave the opinions of others, and desire outside validation. In my head, social media is a major factor in this, and young people today are suffering from anxiety more than ever. So it may be difficult, but I think the first step is to accept who you are.
