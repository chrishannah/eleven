title: Focus in a Distracted World
---

I wrote recently about my feelings on using older products, and how they can still function many years on. And with good timing, [Joshua Blais](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1tV5SjRyejRGeHAaMGYSsQ), one of my current favourite YouTubers, made [a great video about the products he uses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NM1wgyNcIo).

As mentioned in the videoâ€™s title, he uses a 10 year old Thinkpad laptop currently. But he also goes over the other products he uses, and how he splits his use cases across his devices to keep contexts clearly defined and separated.
