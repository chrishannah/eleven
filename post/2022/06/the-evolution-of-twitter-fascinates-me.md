title: The Evolution of Twitter Fascinates Me
---

Twitter has just started to roll out a new composer tool, [Twitter Write](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/notes), which adds the support to write long-form content. It allows users to write a **note**, which can essentially be seen as a blog post, just hosted on Twitter itself. There are still limits to what you can write in a note, with the title being limited to 100 characters, and the body having a limit of 2,500 words.

In some ways, I find this feature to be an obvious addition to the platform, especially given the number of Notes app screenshots, or “TwitLonger” links shared on the platform. There’s clearly a demand to share more than 280 characters.

However, I think this feature is a lot more than just a mechanism of increasing the character limit. Especially if you think of the other features that have been added to Twitter in the last year or so.

To some, Twitter should be used as a pure chronological timeline, of tweets from the accounts that you follow. But it’s clear that Twitter as a platform is becoming more of an ecosystem, in which multiple social networking services exist.

Just to name a few of the recent additions, there’s got [Spaces](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces) that brings live audio conversations to the platform, [Communities](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/communities) that allows groups of people to create dedicated places for people to connect, [Shopping](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2022/twitter-shops-more-space-to-shop) is a recent experimental addition, and soon people will be able to post longer written content via [Notes](https://twitter.com/i/notes/1539382544856035328). For a platform that was originally designed to share tiny pieces of text, it’s evolved substantially.

On top of all of that, there’s [Twitter Blue](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue), [Super Follows](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/super-follows-creator), [Tips](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/bringing-tips-to-everyone), and a ton more that I’ve forgotten about.

It’s fascinating to me to see the visible evolution of the platform. And while the big elephant in the room is Elon Musk, I’d still prefer to keep a positive mindset on the situation and think about the ways the platform could still improve.
