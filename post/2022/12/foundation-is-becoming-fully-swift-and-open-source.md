title: Foundation Is Becoming Fully Swift and Open Source
---

"The Future of Foundation", [Swift.org](https://www.swift.org/blog/future-of-foundation/):

> Today, we are announcing a new open source Foundation project, written in Swift, for Swift.

I saw this being talked about earlier on Twitter by people that understand this sort of stuff much more than me. But my first reactions were:

1. I didn't know Foundation wasn't already in Swift.
2. I wonder if I can become a contributer.

The post has the project launching on GitHub in 2023, which isn't that helpful. Still, it would be pretty cool to say I contributed to Foundation.
