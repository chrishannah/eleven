title: Apple Wants Yet Another 30%
---

[Mitchell Clark for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/1/23488448/coinbase-ios-wallet-app-apple-nft-fees-in-app-purchase-store):

> Coinbase has accused Apple of forcing it to remove NFT transfers from its Wallet app on iOS. On Thursday, [it tweeted](https://twitter.com/CoinbaseWallet/status/1598354819735031809?s=20&t=8GHQNZu2kGZg8HJF3WcZLw) that Apple “blocked our last app release until we disabled the feature” because the iPhone maker wanted the blockchain fees associated with an NFT transfer to go through its in-app purchase system, giving it a 30 percent cut.

Lol, what?

[Coinbase via Twitter](https://twitter.com/coinbasewallet/status/1598354820905197576?s=61&t=QLKqRrG0OQx-c1AF01gyKA):

> Apple’s claim is that the gas fees required to send NFTs need to be paid through their In-App Purchase system, so that they can collect 30% of the gas fee.

Apple did update their App Store guidelines in October to mention rules around NFTs. [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase) (3.1.1):

> Apps may use in-app purchase to sell and sell services related to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), such as minting, listing, and transferring. Apps may allow users to view their own NFTs, provided that NFT ownership does not unlock features or functionality within the app. Apps may allow users to browse NFT collections owned by others, provided that the apps may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.

I guess it's a rule now. So you could argue that Coinbase just have to get on with it. But this all does seem like yet another greedy move from Apple.
