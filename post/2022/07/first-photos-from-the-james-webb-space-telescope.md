title: First Photos from The James Webb Space Telescope
---

The [James Webb Space Telescope](https://webbtelescope.org), lauched December 2021, has now produced it's first images. And they are incredible.

Perhaps the most impressive image, is the image known as "[Webb's First Deep Field](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-038?Collection=First%20Images)", which is the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the universe. But there's also [images of the Southern Ring Nebula](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/033/01G709QXZPFH83NZFAFP66WVCZ), the group of galaxies known as [Stephan's Quintet](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/034/01G7DA5ADA2WDSK1JJPQ0PTG4A), the edge of [a star-forming region in the Carina Nebula](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/031/01G77PKB8NKR7S8Z6HBXMYATGJ), and analysis on [the atmosphere of a hot gas giant exoplanet](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/032/01G72VSFW756JW5SXWV1HYMQK4).

The images are amazing, and my brain can't comprehend that thay aren't just CGI, and are in fact part of our universe.

Here are my two favourite images that have been released:
