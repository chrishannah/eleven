title: The iPhone Will Switch To USB-C

[Mark Gurman for Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-26/apple-will-comply-with-iphone-usb-c-charger-law-exec-says?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_content=business):

> Joswiak said that the company will comply as it does with other laws. He declined to specify when the iPhone may get the charger to replace Lightning.[...]He said Apple and the EU had been at odds over chargers for a decade, recalling how European authorities once wanted Apple to adopt Micro-USB. He said that neither Lightning -- the current iPhone charging port -- nor the now-ubiquitous USB-C would have been invented if that switch had occurred.

I wonder if the EU law works somewhat in Appleâ€™s favour here. Apple were clearly already on a journey to USB-C with the rest of their products. Although some would argue, the iPhone was destined to be port-less. However, this allows Apple to redirect any possible negativity towards the switch to USB-C to the EU.

I [wrote about this proposal last September](https://chrishannah.me/the-eu-want-to-enforce-usb-c-as-a-universal-common-charger-by-2024/), and it's funny to see how I felt just over a year ago. Especially since my position on it has softened quite substantially. To be honest, I'm now starting to think that it _might_ be a good idea.

When I list all the devices I use, Macs, ThinkPad, Nintendo Switch, iPad, Pixel 6,  work phone (it's some Motorola Android phone), and iPhone 13, only one of them uses a port that's not USB-C. I didn't realise it until now, but the same applies for peripherals and accessories. The only non-USB-C (wired) accessory I use is my wired EarPods. And that's only because Apple removed the headphone jack and used Lightning on the iPhone 13.

So I think I'm quite looking forward to it actually. That might not neccesarily mean I'm going to buy the next iPhone, but it being USB-C is definitely a positive for me.
