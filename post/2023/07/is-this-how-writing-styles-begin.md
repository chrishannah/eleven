title: Is this how writing styles begin?
---

Sometimes when I write long blog posts, I like to run the text through Grammarly as a way to pick up on some spelling or grammar mistakes that I may have missed. But sometimes, it tries to make me "less wordy", remove words that "aren't necessary", or change the whole tone of the post.

In the past, I would blindly accept any suggestion that was made. Because surely Grammarly knew best? Maybe I just can't write properly.

But I'm now becoming of the opinion, that seeing as this is a personal blog, my writing should mirror the way I think and talk. I'm not creating legal documents, marketing material, or a school textbook, this blog is about _me_, so it should probably sound like me too.
