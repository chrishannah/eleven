> I've often wondered how I would start my digital identity again. This wouldn't be applicable to me but rather for anyone just starting out down the path. Knowing what I know now, I'd definitely do things a little differently.If I was to start over again, here's what I would do. I think I could do it rather cheaply as well.

A fascinating read, and one that seems to me would be effective at the goal of creating a digital identity that was separate from your real one.

I can't say that I'm currently in the market for a new identity, I quite enjoy being myself. But, it does give an interesting perspective into digital life. They go over a possible computer set up, way of getting money, and a few other rules on what to do and not to do.
