title: Analogue Pocket Now Comes in Authentic GameBoy Colours
---

Andrew Webster, [writing at The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/15/23961099/analogue-pocket-special-edition-classic-colors-gameboy-advance):

> Analogue seems obsessed with recreating the Game Boy family as faithfully as possible. For its latest endeavor, it’s bringing the classic colorways of the Game Boy Advance and Pocket to the Analogue Pocket. These Classic Limited Edition Pockets have, according to the press release, been “carefully color-matched” to resemble the colors of the Game Boys of old, offering blue, green, indigo, spice orange, pink, red, silver, and yellow.

I've been interested in the Analogue Pocket for some time. Although I've always held back because I'm not sure if I'd actually use it.

However, I have to say, I love it in the true GameBoy colours.
