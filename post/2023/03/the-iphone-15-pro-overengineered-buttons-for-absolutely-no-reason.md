title: 'The iPhone 15 Pro: Overengineered Buttons for Absolutely No Reason'

Tim Hardwick, [for MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/iphone-15-pro-low-energy-microprocessor/):

> The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will use a new ultra-low energy microprocessor allowing certain features like the new capacitive solid-state buttons to remain functional even when the handset is powered off or the battery has run out...

For a while, I've been thinking that the iPhone may be my next phone. I thought they'd refine a few things, and also switch to USB C finally. But the idea of these _"new capacitive solid-state buttons"_ make me think otherwise_._
