title: The feeling of film photography
---

I just wrote about [my recent experience with shooting film](https://chrishannah.me/ive-finally-got-some-35mm-film-developed/), and I already have something else to say about it.

Because I noticed something, the  apparent lower quality of film photos doesn't bother me at all. If anything, I'd say the soft focus, harsh shadows, blown-out highlights, and of course, the grain, gives the photo character.

After I got my scans back, I noticed that I wasn't drawn to edit them that much. Whereas with the RAW files from my mirrorless camera, I'm sucked into changing the entire aesthetic and fiddling with any slider or number I can.

It was probably the first significant moment when I started thinking of photography as an art form.

I've seen photos before and been amazed by them, in a whole bunch of ways, but there's something visceral about film that I can't quite explain.
