title: Text Case CLI 1.4
---

I'm on holiday in Gran Canaria this week, and whilst I was sitting on a sun lounger, I decided that I'd add a few more formats to the Text Case CLI tool.

Coming in the latest release ([version 1.4](https://github.com/chrishannah/textcase-cli/releases/tag/1.4)), are 5 more formats which are all different counts:

- countCharacters -Count number of characters.
- countCharactersExclWhitespace - Count number of characters, excluding any whitespace characters.
- countWords - Count number of words.
- countLines - Count number of lines.
- countLinesExclBlanks - Count number of lines, excluding any blank lines.

That now means Text Case CLI has 49 different formats.

You can find installation instructions on the [Text Case CLI GitHub repo](https://github.com/chrishannah/textcase-cli).

While you're there, I'd encourage you to show any appreciation with a star or a watch, since I'd like to eventually move this tool to an official Homebrew cask. And one of the requirements of that is that the repo must be *notable* as in over 30 forks, 30 watchers, and 75 stars.
