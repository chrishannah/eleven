title: Matter as a Read Out Loud Service
---

If you haven't heard of [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.com), it's a pretty powerful reading tool, that can serve as a basic read-it-later service, or or more complex reading system.

While I don't use it fully, I've found one feature to be very useful for when I want to read long-form posts, but while I'm doing something like playing a game or doing chores. I'm sure it has a fancy name, but it's the text-to-voice feature.

It's super easy to use, just send over an article to reader (I tend to use the Safari extension), and then inside reader, you can just press the play button to have it start reading the post to you.

Maybe in the future I'll use Matter for actually reading posts. But right now, it's meaning that I can read a lot more blog posts than before, and I can sit and play World of Warcraft at the same time.
