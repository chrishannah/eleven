title: What is Happening with iPhone Camera?
---

Marques Brownlee has made a great [video about the iPhone camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88kd9tVwkH8), how it's evolved over the years, and it's position in the current landscape of software-based photography advancements.

9to5Mac also [published a piece based on the video](https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/06/mkbhd-post-processing-ruining-iphone-photos/), around the subject of the exaggeration of the iPhone's post-processing techniques.

I don't feel like I have a particularly strong opinion on the iPhone camera, or even more specifically, it's post-processing. However, I do think it would be a good idea if there was a bit more control around this sort of stuff. I've had a few occasions where photos looked a bit odd, usually a sky being strangely blue (for Britain), or a sunset/golden hour scene missing the orange glow. So it would be nice to be able to at least see if turning off the various software tricks would improve that.
