<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of occasions where I&#8217;m checking the specific iOS icon sizes, and I remember I made a document a few years ago with some references. However, there&#8217;s been a huge amount of changes since then. So I decided to create a new reference document from the Xcode 9.0 beta.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s <a href="https://gist.github.com/chrishannah/8dae4283f323f125ed259f6c50028631">hosted as a Gist on Github</a>, or you can view it below:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to make an effort to keep this updated, and I&#8217;ll probably create one for the other platforms as well. Anyway, I hope people find this useful!</p>
