title: What's Coming to iA Writer 5 for iPhone
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>iA Writer 5 is scheduled to be released at the end of September, and there’s one feature that they’ve already announced, and I love it.</p>
<p>It’s a <a href="https://vimeo.com/232726373?ref=chrishannah.me">configurable keyboard</a>!</p>
<p>Above the iOS keyboard on an iPhone, you usually get the little keyboard row where apps can add shortcuts to functionality, and also for basic things like undo and redo. But iA have gone a step further, and not only added some cool features like the ability to search through actions, files, and text in a document, but a customisable keyboard that opens up when you tap the ⌘ key.</p>
<p>You get the standard markdown syntax for things like headers, links, footnotes, lists, etc. But also the ability to swap and rearrange them.</p>
<p>You can see for yourself some of the available keys in <a href="https://vimeo.com/232726373?ref=chrishannah.me">their video</a>, but I imagine there will be a load more when it’s released.</p>
