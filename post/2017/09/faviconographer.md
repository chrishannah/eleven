title: Finally Favicons in Safari
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>A lot of people would like Safari to show favicons in the tab bar, just like Chrome does. And it’s been the subject on various blog posts, and podcasts. But it was a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/08/safari_should_display_favicons_in_its_tabs">post by John Gruber</a>, that got <a href="https://timingapp.com/?ref=chrishannah.me">Timing</a> developer <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_a_a">Daniel Alm</a> interested.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-399" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-11-at-23.23.40.png"  /></p>
<p>He then went on and made an app called <a href="https://faviconographer.com/?ref=chrishannah.me">Faviconographer</a>, that doesn’t exactly add that feature to Safari, but instead analyses Safari and the current tabs, and overlays the relevant favicon where it <em>should</em> be.</p>
<p>It’s not perfect, but it does make Safari much better. I just can’t believe it’s still not an official feature.</p>
<p>You can download Faviconographer, and also read more about how it works, the current limitations, and also some other information on the app on the <a href="https://faviconographer.com/?ref=chrishannah.me">Faviconographer website</a>.</p>
