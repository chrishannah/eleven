title: I'm Developing a New App!
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>If you follow me on Twitter, you&#8217;ll already know this, but I&#8217;m now developing a regular expression app for iOS!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called &#8220;Pretty Regular Expressions&#8221;, and I&#8217;m going for a minimal approach, but with some optional settings, and a clean interface. Of course a dark theme was the first thing I built!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still in development, but it&#8217;s moving pretty fast, so an open beta is very imminent. I already have a <a href="https://chrishannah.me/Pretty/">landing page</a>, where you can subscribe to keep updated with the application. Of course I will only send out an email for when the beta opens, and then when the app is released.</p>
<p>If you want to watch the progress of the development, then just follow me on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/chrishannah">@chrishannah</a>, because I post <em>a lot</em> of screenshots.</p>
