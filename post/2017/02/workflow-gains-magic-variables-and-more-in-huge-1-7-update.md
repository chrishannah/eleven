<p>Federico Viticci, the King of iOS Automation has just written a great piece, regarding <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/workflow-1-7-introduces-magic-variables-for-easier-more-powerful-visual-automation/">the latest update to Workflow for iOS</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>With today&#8217;s 1.7 update, the Workflow team isn&#8217;t introducing Instant Variables. Instead, they&#8217;ve rebuilt the engine behind variables on a new system called Magic Variables, which completely reimagines how you can create workflows and connect actions for even more powerful automations.</p>
<p>More than a mere tweak for power users, Magic Variables are the next step in Workflow&#8217;s goal to enable everyone to automate their iOS devices. By making workflows easier to create and read, Magic Variables are the app&#8217;s most important transformation to date, and the result far exceeds my expectations.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not a full time iOS user for work purposes, but with the features and innovation that is happening on the iOS platform, it makes me ever so more curious to take a bigger step. Just today I we looking at my automation options on macOS, and although there&#8217;s things like Keyboard Maestro, or the built-in Automator, there just isn&#8217;t a Workflow alternative.</p>
<p>Time like these make me wonder what it would be like moving fully over to iOS, but as an app developer it seems like I&#8217;ll be to macOS for a while. I&#8217;m certainly not saying I dislike the Mac platform, I&#8217;m a huge fan of it, and I&#8217;m loving my new Touch Bar MacBook Pro, but there&#8217;s just more happening over there.</p>
<p>The grass seems greener.</p>
