title: Mythperceptions No, Apple is actually pretty good at design

<div class="kg-card-markdown"><!-- link[http://www.macworld.com/article/3168885/ios/mythperceptions-no-apple-is-actually-pretty-good-at-design.html] --></p>
<p>The Macalope has another great piece on <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3168885/ios/mythperceptions-no-apple-is-actually-pretty-good-at-design.html">the common misconceptions about Apple&#8217;s design</a>, and it&#8217;s an opinion I quite agree with.</p>
<p>I encourage everyone to read it, but I just wanted to share my favourite quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe the problem isn’t Apple’s choices, it’s the fact that so many Apple competitors refuse to make their own choices of the same kind.</p>
