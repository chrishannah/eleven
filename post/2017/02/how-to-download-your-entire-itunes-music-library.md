title: 'How To: Download Your Entire iTunes Music Library'
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>If you&#8217;re an Apple Music subscriber, or you just have a super large iTunes library, then downloading all of your music to a device can be a giant pain.</p>
<p>With the iPhone storage sizes getting bigger, having your entire collection downloaded is even more of a possibility. I for example have a 128GB iPhone 7 Plus, so I easily have enough space for my entire library.</p>
<p>The only problem is that on iOS, there isn&#8217;t a &#8220;download all&#8221; button. However there&#8217;s a really simple solution if you have a Mac available.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> &#8211; In the sidebar, right click and choose Create Smart Playlist.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-520" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-02-01-at-21-19-48-1.png"  /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> &#8211; Change the rules to &#8220;Artist is not (blank)&#8221; like the image below.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-521" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-02-01-at-21-20-05-1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> &#8211; Open the Playlist in the Music app on your iOS device.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> &#8211; Tap on the &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; button in the top right, and press Download.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-522" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_1376-PNG-1.png"/></p>
<p>That&#8217;s it!</p>
<p>All of your music library should then start to download.</p>
<p>Another bonus that this gives you, is that because it&#8217;s a Smart Playlist, it will continue to update as you add music to your library. As the rule simply is that it matches any item where the Artist name isn&#8217;t blank, which should be all of them!</p>
