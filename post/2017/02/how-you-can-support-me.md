title: How You Can Support Me
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown"><!-- link[https://www.patreon.com/chrishannah] --></p>
<p>A bit of a weird post today, but I’ve come to the realisation that I need to find a way to fund myself through the last bit of my university course.</p>
<p>I spend nearly all of my time doing one of two things, university work, or developing things for everyone. Whether it’s a new application, a website, or something, I’m always making stuff.</p>
<p>I guess most people would simply raise the prices of their products, in order to try and make more money, but I don’t really want to do that. I want to reward people for backing what I do, so this is what I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://getqwiki.co">Qwiki</a>, my Wikipedia app for Mac has been discounted (indefinitely) from £3.99 to £2.99.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrishannah.me/Pretty/">Pretty Regular Expressions</a>, my upcoming regular expressions app for iOS and macOS will only be £0.99.</li>
<li>All of <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/developer/christopher-r-hannah/id449002455?mt=8&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=myself">my other apps</a> are completely free. This includes my fun pixel art <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pixels-sticker-pack/id1155175303?mt=8&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=myself">iMessage Sticker Pack</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>Why would I make everything free, or really cheap? Because I trust everyone that finds my content useful, wants to help me in what I do, or simply is a super awesome person will back me.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve set up <a href="https://www.patreon.com/chrishannah">a Patreon page</a>. Honestly I feel a bit dirty doing this, because I don&#8217;t want to <em>ask</em> for your money, but if I can balance this out by creating some awesome projects, then I think I can make sense of it.</p>
<p>If you can support me, then it really is a case of anything helps. The costs associate with University (especially in London) are stupid, and then there&#8217;s my desire to make things that also adds to that, even a coffee will help me through the day.</p>
<hr>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry though, because I&#8217;ll have a good announcement in a few days relating to a certain app I&#8217;m making!</p>
