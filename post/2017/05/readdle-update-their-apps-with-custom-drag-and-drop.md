title: Readdle Update Their Apps With Custom Drag and Drop
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>With iOS 11 days from being announced, you wouldn&#8217;t expect a great deal of big updates to apps. But Readdle have implemented a feature, that most iOS users have been waiting for &#8211; Drag and Drop.</p>
<p>So on their iPad apps &#8211; Documents, PDF Expert, Scanner Pro and Spark, you will be able to drag items from one app to another when using Split View.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to write thousands of words explaining this new feature, because it just wouldn&#8217;t do it justice. Instead, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epzh9-rd-AI">Readdles&#8217;s demo video</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s truly impressive, and it&#8217;s what I expect a native drag and drop feature on iOS would look like. Their own implementation would of took a huge amount of work, and they&#8217;ve really made it look seamless. One point I have to make though, is that if Drag and Drop is announced for iOS 11, would this custom implementation be the best way to do it?</p>
<p>But leaving the pessimistic thoughts alone, this is an incredible feature, and makes me want to try out even more of Readdle&#8217;s apps.</p>
