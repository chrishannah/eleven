title: Jason Kottke’s Social Media Fast

<p>Something I’ve thought of doing before, but never really got around to, is having a break from social media. Jason Kottke <a href="http://kottke.org/17/05/my-social-media-fast">spent a week “fasting” from social media</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week (approx. May 7-14), I stopped using social media for an entire week. I logged out of all the sites and deleted the apps from my phone. I didn’t so much as peek at Instagram, which is, with Twitter and old-school Flickr, probably my favorite online service of all time. I used Twitter as minimally as I could, for work only.1 I didn’t check in anywhere on Swarm. No Facebook. As much as I could, I didn’t use my phone. I left it at home when I went to the grocery store. I didn’t play any games on it. I left it across the room when I went to bed and when I worked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of this is very interesting to me, and his findings also made me think about doing something similar myself.</p>
<p>The whole outcome that I got from this piece, was that it’s more about not using a phone, than using social media specifically.</p>
<p>This is one of my favourite parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the week was up, I greedily checked in on Instagram and Facebook to see what I had missed. Nothing much, of course. Since then, I’ve been checking them a bit less. When I am on, I’ve been faving and commenting more in an attempt to be a little more active in connecting. I unfollowed some accounts I realized I didn’t care that much about and followed others I’ve been curious to check out. Swarm I check a lot less, about once a day — there was a lot of FOMO going on when I saw friends checked in at cool places in NYC or on vacations in Europe. And I’m only checking in when I go someplace novel, just to keep a log of where I’ve been…that’s always fun to look back on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is something that I regularly experience, albeit very short lived. It normally happens after a holiday abroad, where the use of a phone is diminished. Usually by either the international usage costs, or just because the people that I’d be contacting, were there with me physically.</p>
<p>I’ve started to evaluate my computer usage in general recently, and I think of it as a refining process. Hopefully with things like automation, and better focus on specific tasks will make it easier.</p>
