title: A Backend Engineers Experience on Switching to an iPad Pro
---

<p>Jannis Hermanns took on a rather interesting challenge recently, and it was all about <a href="https://jann.is/ipad-pro-for-programming/">working from an iPad Pro</a>.</p>
<p>But unlike most people that make the switch, he’s not a writer, manager, or a designer. Jannis is a backend engineer, that uses some terminal in some hardcore ways!</p>
<blockquote><p>In the summer of 2017, I wanted to know what it would be like to use an iPad Pro as my main computer. I found out that it can actually work, thanks to an iOS app called Blink, an SSH replacement called Mosh, iOS 11 and running stuff on a server.</p></blockquote>
<p>His perspective/experience I find, is different than most other macOS to iOS switching articles, as there was a lot more technical issues that had to be solved.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, he managed it in the end.</p>
<p>Sadly for myself though, this switch isn’t something that I could do myself any time soon, as I develop 99% of the time using Xcode. Sure, I could probably run that on a Mac, and use a iPad to operate it. But what’s the point in that.</p>
