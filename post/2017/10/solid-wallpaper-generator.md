<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Just over a week ago, I really wanted to set a plain colour background to my iPad. I had a quick look on the App Store, but nothing just did the feature I wanted. So I ended up <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah/status/919991940082520064">starting my own mini project</a>.</p>
<p>It took a few hours to make, and I had to make it support iPhone, iPad, and all the sizes they both come in. In the end it was probably as simple as the implementation could be, but that’s what I wanted myself.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-313" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/chrishannah_2017-Oct-17-149x300.png" /></p>
<p>The app can be broken down into 5 elements &#8211; three sliders for the hue, saturation, and brightness, followed by a save/share button so you can save the image or do whatever you want with it. Then there’s the background of the app, which shows the currently selected colour. So you literally get to see a live preview of the wallpaper.</p>
<p>Shortly after making this app, I thought back to my post on <a href="https://chrishannah.me/app-store-cleanout/">clearing out my current selection of apps on the App Store</a>. But like I said in that post, some apps don’t require much maintenance, and I this app will fit in to that category. So although I do plan on keeping it up to date, you can see yourself how simple that will be.</p>
<p>Of course, I couldn’t charge for an app this simple. So it is <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/solid-wallpaper-generator/id1297022179?at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=SOLID_CH_BLOG&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8">available for free on the App Store</a>!</p>
