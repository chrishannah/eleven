title: My App Store Clear-out
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>As I’ve been getting back into development for Hydrate (a water intake tracker for iOS), I’ve been thinking about the sort of representation of myself as a developer.</p>
<p>When I think of a <em>great</em> developer, they usually have a small number of apps. Sometimes they’re all at a really high standard, but most independent developers I see, have one or two <em>main</em> apps, and a few more fun ones.</p>
<p>I have been developing for iOS/macOS for quite a few years, and I have to say most of them are dead, stale, or heading in that direction. So it’s time for a clear out. This might not be a very interesting article, but I certainly think the act of me writing this, will aid in the process.</p>
<p>For some background information, here is the list of apps that I’ve made for iOS/macOS, and their current status.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hydrate</td>
<td>iOS/watchOS</td>
<td>Available.</td>
<td>My current work-in-progress, a water intake tracker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pretty Regular Expressions</td>
<td>iOS/macOS</td>
<td>Available.</td>
<td>Regular expression tool for macOS/iOS. Very simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pixels Sticker Pack</td>
<td>iOS</td>
<td>Available.</td>
<td>Some pixel art iMessage stickers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AniMatchers</td>
<td>iPhone</td>
<td>Available.</td>
<td>Just a fun memory matching game, with cartoon animals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bill Splitter</td>
<td>iOS/watchOS</td>
<td>Available.</td>
<td>A super basic bill splitter. Mainly a small project so I could check out the watch SDK.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Qwiki</td>
<td>macOS</td>
<td>Available.</td>
<td>My wikipedia menu bar app, which is one of my best projects in my opinion, which I will hopefully update soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tap Gap</td>
<td>iOS</td>
<td>Available.</td>
<td>A quick game for iOS, where you try and tap the screen when a line is between a certain gap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Floppy Turd</td>
<td>iOS</td>
<td>Available.</td>
<td>An awful, but funny remake of Flappy Birds. It took a sunday morning to create, and that was where I left it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TinyMe</td>
<td>iOS/macOS</td>
<td>Removed.</td>
<td>One of my first few apps, they used the goo.gl api to shorten longer links, but they aren&#8217;t an issue anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Postie</td>
<td>macOS</td>
<td>Available.</td>
<td>I used to blog on Scriptogram, and this was a basic Markdown editor with publishing built in. The service has unfortunately shut down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Girlfriend Helper</td>
<td>iOS</td>
<td>Removed.</td>
<td>I think <em>the</em> first app I made. It was an app that suggested message you could send to your girlfriend depending on the event type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Halloween FX</td>
<td>iOS</td>
<td>Removed.</td>
<td>Basic soundboard app, which also featured a timer so you could hide your phone and scare someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Farm</td>
<td>iOS</td>
<td>Removed.</td>
<td>Even more basic soundboard app, just contained farm animals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bug Splatter</td>
<td>iOS</td>
<td>Removed.</td>
<td>This was a weird one, there&#8217;s multiple levels of bugs/difficulty, and the aim was to splat as many of them before they reached the end of the screen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Whack</td>
<td>iOS</td>
<td>Removed.</td>
<td>A pretty simple whack-a-mole game, but with pixel art, and funny noises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TextShot</td>
<td>macOS</td>
<td>Never made it.</td>
<td>This was a really fun project to work on, it was going to be an app where you could select a bunch of text, and it would generate a picture from it, even including multiple different styles. Sadly the MacBook I was using at the time died completely, and I wasn&#8217;t clever enough to think about source control back then.</td>

<p>Okay, I didn’t actually know I already removed a few of these already. But there’s still some clearing out to do.</p>
<p>My aim is to have a small number of applications, that either are stable, and need hardly any maintenance, or ones that I can regularly keep updated, and are proven to be worthwhile.</p>
<p>So if you just take the apps I have available, there’s 9. Well one isn’t released yet, but it’s in progress.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hydrate</li>
<li>Pretty Regular Expressions</li>
<li>Pixels Sticker Pack</li>
<li>AniMatchers</li>
<li>Bill Splitter</li>
<li>Qwiki</li>
<li>Tap Gap</li>
<li>Floppy Turd</li>
<li>Postie</li>
</ul>
<p>If I separate them into the groups I mentioned before, I’m left with this:</p>
<p><strong>Maintainable Apps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hydrate</li>
<li>Qwiki</li>
<li>Pretty Regular Expressions?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minimal Effort/Stable Apps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pixels Sticker Pack</li>
<li>Tap Gap</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Left over:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AniMatchers</li>
<li>Bill Splitter</li>
<li>Floppy Turd</li>
<li>Postie</li>
</ul>
<p>That was pretty quick and easy, and it sort of represents what I already had in my head. Out of the four left over, they all have very good reasons why I don’t want to support them anymore. Low download numbers, super old code, and lack of interest to work on them again.</p>
<p>So, they’re be removed.</p>
<p>That leaves just five remaining apps, three I feel that are maintainable, and the other two are kind of eternal to an extent.</p>
<p>Of course Hydrate will stay, I mean I haven’t even released it, and it’s still in active development. Qwiki is stable, and my most popular app, so that will also stay.</p>
<p>Pretty Regular Expressions however was initially well taken, but I haven’t had any desire really to go back to it, and improve it. I will have a look at the code again, and hopefully I can add something to make the app even better soon.</p>
<p>Pixels Sticker Pack is a bunch of images, and I can’t see myself ever needing to update these. They’re fun, and I still enjoy using them!</p>
<p>That leaves Tap Gap, it’s a simple game, that still works fine. I’ll certainly make a few changes and support the iPhone X soon, but that is only a minor issue.</p>
<p>So the remaining apps, along with their pricing are:</p>
