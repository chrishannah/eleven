<p>At this years MacSysAdmin conference, Sal Soghoian (the king of automation) talked about his new role at the Omni Group, and work that they have been focussing on.</p>
<p>The talk was titled &#8220;OmniJS: Automation Magic comes to iOS and macOS&#8221;, and you can guess everything from that. There&#8217;s a bunch of demos from Sal, showing off the new scripting possibilities (on iOS and macOS), and it&#8217;s really impressive.</p>
<p>You can find the video, presentation slides, and information on the entire conference at the <a href="http://docs.macsysadmin.se/2017/2017doc.html">MacSysAdmin 2017 page</a>.</p>
