<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>f you&rsquo;ve ever been to an arcade, then you&rsquo;ll know that there are a few classics that you always go back to. In <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pocket-arcade-coins-claw-basketball-more/id1111754142?mt=8">Pocket Arcade</a>, you get to experience the four main ones. They are even managed by coins, so there&rsquo;s a chance to run out of money just like in real life.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got UFO Catcher, which is a grabbing style game. It&rsquo;s not as weak as the ones in real life, but it can still become equally as irritating when you just miss a prize. Then there is Mayan Coin Pusher, which is the coin machine we all have probably left too much money on. Alien Whacker is the class Whack-a-mole game, and this is really fun. And lastly, there is Hoop Hero, which is a mini version of the basketball shooting game, which I find to be really suited to the iPhone.</p>
<p>All the prizes you collect are stored in the Gallery, and there are over 200 different prizes to collect at the moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen similar games on the iPhone already, but this little collection of games are very well designed, and there&rsquo;s also chances of more getting added in the future.</p>
<p>You can download <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pocket-arcade-coins-claw-basketball-more/id1111754142?mt=8">Pocket Arcade for iOS</a> for free on the App Store.</p>
