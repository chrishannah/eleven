title: Qwiki is now 1/3 off!
---

<p>My app Qwiki is now 1/3 off!</p>
<p>Purely because it hasn&#8217;t received so much attention recently (except the most recent minor update of course).</p>
<p>Therefore this discount will last until I release version 1.4. Which means a totally flexible timescale, anywhere between a few weeks and maybe even a couple of months if it&#8217;s a huge update!</p>
