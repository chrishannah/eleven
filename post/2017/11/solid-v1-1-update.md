title: SOLID v1.1 Update
---

<p>Some good improvements to SOLID!</p>
<p>In v1.0, the app was a simple single view that allowed you to manipulate sliders to generate a single colour wallpaper image.</p>
<p>In v1.1, you will be able to save the colours, and also get access to a couple standard colours, for example an absolute black for the iPhone X.</p>
<p>This also means that there has to be a list of the saved colours, and that allows for more detail to be shown about each colour.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve integrated the <a href="https://github.com/js/WaddaColor">WaddaColor</a> Swift library, which automatically generates a name for a given colour. That single addition, gives everything a bit more character.</p>
<p>But also just for the helpfulness, I added in the HEX and RGB representation!</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll be packing this all up now, and shipping it off to the App Store for review!</p>
