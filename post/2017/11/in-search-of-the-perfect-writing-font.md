title: In Search of the Perfect Writing Font
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Here&#8217;s something interesting &#8211; The guys over at iA (devleopers of the iA Writer app), have <a href="https://ia.net/topics/in-search-of-the-perfect-writing-font/">made their own font</a>. Prevously the apps used a font called Nitti, which kind of became part of the iA brand, but they took it upon themselves to develop a more writing focussed option.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hell just froze over. After seven years of offering no font options to write, iA Writer now comes with a choice. Next to the monospace Nitti you will now find a brand new duospace font. Duospace?</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>For an app that was designed as the digital equivalent of a typewriter, a monospace font is not a far fetch. But, if font choice were just a matter of style, there are better and less expensive ways to impress than leasing a high end monospaced typeface that many take for a silly Courier.</p></blockquote>
<p>There was clearly a lot of investigastion that went into it, and I&#8217;m a fan of the results!</p>
