<p>The second week of the new format, and I’m really liking it! It’s more manual collation at the minute, but I’m going to start investigation different ways to try and pull the data into one place easier.</p>
<p>In the initial format, I just used a tag on Pinboard, and while that is still serving me well for the “Interesting Links” section, I know I can do more.</p>
<p>Anyway, here it is:</p>

Not impossible, but <em>hard</em>.</p>

<h2 id="whatimupto">What I’m Up To</h2>
<p>This week hasn’t been super productive for me, I’ve mainly been at work and playing games.</p>
<p>One thing I have been working on though, is a very minimal Swift framework called “CHEssentials”. It’s not a big open source project or anything, but there are a bunch of things I <em>always</em> do when writing Swift apps, that I just want to stick in one place, so I can reuse them.</p>
<p>It’s quite small right now, but as I’m writing Swift, I’m always updating it. The most beneficial ones for me are the String/Date parsing, and rounding numbers.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/chrishannah/CHEssentials">find it on GitHub</a>, and feel free to do whatever you want with it!</p>
