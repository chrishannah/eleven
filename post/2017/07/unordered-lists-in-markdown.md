title: Unordered Lists in Markdown

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/07/unordered_lists_in_markdown">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Markdown, you can create unordered lists using any of three characters as the “bullets”: asterisk (*), hyphen (-), or plus (+). Why all three? More or less: why not? Better to let people choose the character that feels most natural to them. I know a lot of Markdown users choose different characters for different levels of hierarchical lists, and that went into the original thinking as well.</p>
<p>I’ve always been curious which list markers people actually use, so I did a poll on Twitter. The results:</p>
<ul>
<li>42% Asterisk (*)</li>
<li>54% Hyphen (-)</li>
<li>04% Plus (+)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I&#8217;m a hyphen user. I&#8217;m not against using a plus, because it still feels natural. But I can&#8217;t understand using an asterisk, when they&#8217;re used so much elsewhere in Markdown.</p>
