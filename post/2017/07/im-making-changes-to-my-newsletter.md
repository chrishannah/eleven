title: I'm Making Changes to My Newsletter
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>If you read the last issue of my Weekly Links newsletter, you may of seen my comment about my desire to expand the content. With this weeks issue, I’m going to take a step in that direction.</p>
<p>The past issues have simple been a list of links from all over the internet that I find interesting, it’s pretty simple and very minimal. I’m not saying I want to rich newsletter full of embeds, and images, but I’m going to be separating content into sections, which will lead me into including more content in general. For the beginning at least, it will still be a basic email containing hardly any formatting, but <em>loads</em> of links.</p>
<p>The sections that will be included from this week forward are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interesting Links</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>On the Blog</li>
<li>What I’m Up To</li>
</ul>
<p>They’re pretty explanatory, but the basic idea behind the transition is that the simple list of links is a bit unorganised. And some weeks, it’s simply not very long. But I’ve got content that I post on the blog, there’s tons of great videos that I watch, and I’m always working on something random. So why not share it here?</p>
<p>In the future, I want to add a podcast section, because I sure do listen to <em>a lot</em> of those. But adding a list of everything I’ve listened to isn’t good for me or anyone reading it. So maybe this will be my favourite/recommended episodes, and probably will end up being a less regular section. I was thinking every month, but this is a weekly newsletter, so every 4 weeks is a good alternative.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can <a href="http://tinyletter.com/chrishannah/">sign up for the newsletter right now</a>, which means you’ll have access to the past (boring) issues, and one new one which goes out tonight. All issues are usually send out on the Friday evening, but occasionally I’m busy and it gets pushed to Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Also, for the sake of my sanity. I’ll be starting the new issues at #1.</p>
