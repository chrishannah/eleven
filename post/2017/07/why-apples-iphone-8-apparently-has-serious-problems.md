<p>Gordon Kelly, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2017/07/12/apple-iphone-8-wireless-charging-camera-touch-id-oled/#6154af524278">writing for Forbes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The consistently reliable site reports further iPhone 8 problems exist with the integration of Touch ID into the display, the supply of OLED for the display itself and operation of the new front facing “3D sensor” camera &#8211; which will bring unlocking via facial recognition.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In fact these problems are reported to be so severe that several of the functions will not be available when the phone launches, forcing Apple to enable them later via a software update&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“By all accounts, it’s late in the game for Apple to be wrestling with problems as big as those described above,” concludes Fast Company and that’s certainly true. With mass manufacturing usually starting three months prior to release (and a September unveiling locked in stone) solutions are needed, and quickly.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if they just <em>needed</em> to get an article out about the future iPhone 8, but in my opinion it&#8217;s a load of rubbish.</p>
<p>Sure, <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/883479434560507905">Gruber also said</a> that the charging feature may be sold separately, or just released with a later version of iOS. But it&#8217;s not a real problem, that warrants writing about a &#8220;serious problem&#8221;. The device isn&#8217;t even announced yet, let along being released.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really not a fan of rumour posts, and normally I&#8217;d just ignore it, but this if Forbes! I would of thought they&#8217;d had better things to write about.</p>
