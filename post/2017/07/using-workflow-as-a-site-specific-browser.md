title: Using Workflow as a Site-Specific Browser

<p>Michael Rockwell, <a href="http://initialcharge.net/2017/07/workflow-site-specific-browser/">over at Initial Charge</a> write a piece about a really interesting way to give web apps a more native feel on iOS.</p>
<p>Firstly, he mentions <a href="http://fluidapp.com">Fluid</a>, which is an application for macOS which lets you “convert” web apps into containers that run as normal apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>On macOS, there’s an application available called Fluid, which lets you create site-specific web browsers. Many of us use web apps everyday and Fluid allows you to run them side-by-side with your native applications without being sequestered inside of a web browser. Fluid is a handy little tool that every Mac user should have in their arsenal.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hadn’t heard of Fluid before, so I’m going to try this myself, but it’s not as good as his next suggestion for iOS:</p>
<blockquote><p>To build these site-specific browsers, it just takes two simple actions — a URL action with the web app’s address and the Show Web Page action. When run, Workflow will open up the URL in a Safari View Controller, which gives you access to your action extensions alongside forward, back, and refresh buttons. From there you can give the workflow a name, set an icon color, and a glyph to fit the website or web application’s functionality.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, he uses <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=bftweet">Workflow</a>! It’s something I haven’t thought at all about before, but it makes sense. You can use the standard Safari View Controller inside Workflow, or you make partner it with apps like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sidefari-web-browsing-companion-for-safari/id1046968235?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=bftweet">Sidefari</a>, or maybe even add another layer to it with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/opener-open-links-in-apps/id989565871?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=website">Opener</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve actually just set one up myself to handle my the interface for this blog, which runs on <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you use macOS or iOS, there’s a solution for you in this post!</p>
