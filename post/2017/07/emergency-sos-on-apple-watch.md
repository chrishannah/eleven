title: Emergency SOS on Apple Watch
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>I had my third experience triggering Emergency SOS on my Apple Watch this morning, but this one was the most annoying.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard of it, then <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-set-and-use-emergency-sos-your-iphone-ios-11">iMore has a good guide</a> on what it is and how to set it up. But basically, it&#8217;s something that when triggered, will start beeping loudly while it counts down from 10, and when finished it will call your local emergency services, and share your location with a rather urgent message to your emergency contacts.</p>
<p>To be honest, it sounds really useful. Not something that would get used 99.9% of the time, but it&#8217;s nice to know it&#8217;s there if you need it. However the action to trigger it, is by holding down the buttons on your watch. Which I believe, is a <em>terrible</em> idea.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I&#8217;ve accidentally triggered this a few times. I was pretty sure that I saw somewhere that the latest betas had an issue with cancelling it, I&#8217;m not sure if this is still true, but nothing I did stopped everything from happening. So my watch beeped loudly on the train for 10 seconds, the (not so equal to 911) emergency services were dialled, and my location was shared with a few people. All because I was leaning on my wrist in a weird way when trying to get off the train.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice feature, and is vital to someone in an emergency. But it should be harder to trigger.</p>
