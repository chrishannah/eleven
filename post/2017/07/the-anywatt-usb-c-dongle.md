title: The AnyWatt USB-C Dongle

<div class="kg-card-markdown"><!-- link[https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/7/5/15922220/anywatt-magsafe-usb-c-adapter-laptop-charging-pd-kickstarter-dongle] --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The AnyWatt comes in three versions: one for square-headed chargers, like those found on Lenovo laptops; one for more traditional barrel plugs; and perhaps most surprising, one for Appleâ€™s MagSafe 2 adapter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really don&#8217;t see the amazement at this product, it&#8217;s just an adapter. Sure, the automatic voltage adjustment is nice. But if you have a Mac, are you really going to ask a Lenovo user for their charger?</p>
<p>Just bring your own.</p>
