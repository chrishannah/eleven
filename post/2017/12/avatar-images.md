<p>The avatar images &#8220;work‚Äù!</p>
<p>I have them displaying properly, downloading properly, and also using placeholders when it hasn&#8217;t been downloaded yet.</p>
<p>Images also cache up to a predefined limit, and are stored with the URL as a key.</p>
<p>The only thing left, is to then update whatever is presenting the placeholder image, when the real one has finished downloading.</p>
