title: 'YouTube Rewind: The Shape of 2017'

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>YouTube have again, of course, released their annual Rewind video.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always impressed with the overall production quality of these videos, and maybe I&#8217;m forgetting the previous ones, but this looks really well made.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>It gets very cheesy at times, which I guess that&#8217;s it&#8217;s meant to be. But the music is mixed well, and it contains a huge number of Youtubers. It would of been funny for PewDiePie to be involved as well though.</p>
