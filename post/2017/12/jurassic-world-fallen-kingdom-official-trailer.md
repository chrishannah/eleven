<p>I don&#8217;t care how clichÃ© this storyline is, but they&#8217;re going back to the island!</p>
<p>And I can&#8217;t wait!</p>
<p>Because, as we all know, life will always find a way.</p>

<p>Description taken from YouTube page:</p>
<blockquote><p>Itâ€™s been four years since theme park and luxury resort Jurassic World was destroyed by dinosaurs out of containment. Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles.</p>
<p>When the islandâ€™s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor whoâ€™s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission. Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.</p></blockquote>
