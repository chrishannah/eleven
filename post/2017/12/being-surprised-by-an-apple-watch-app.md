title: Being Surprised by an Apple Watch App
---

<p>I was pleasantly surprised by an Apple Watch app yesterday! That’s certainly something that doesn’t happen often.</p>
<p>It’s an app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/field-day/id1120218161?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=field_day_micro">Field Day</a>, and it’s just a really simple version of the sort of farming games you get on iOS, where you have to grow crops, wait for a period of time, grow more, etc.</p>
<p>But I was playing around with my watch yesterday, and I found the Field Day app installed. I had no idea what <em>extra</em> functionality could be achieved with such a thing. </p>
<p>Turns out, it’s the entire game!</p>
<p>And it’s completely playable.</p>
<p>But not <em>just</em> playable, it ran like an iPhone app, and (although simple) it was showing 3D graphical models.</p>
<p>My thoughts on what can be achieved on an Apple Watch have most certainly changed.</p>
