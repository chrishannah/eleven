title: Sharing Blog Posts to Micro.Blog Using Workflow!
---

<p>In the <a href="http://www.manton.org/2017/12/major-update-to-micro-blog-today.html">latest update to Micro.blog for iOS</a>, support was added for a URL scheme to start composing a post, and also a <code>text</code> parameter to include some text as well.</p>
<p>I combined this with Workflow, to allow me to share snippets from any website, and then easily write about them here. All it uses, is the article&#8217;s author, the title, and the url. </p>
<p>The format is:</p>
<pre><code>[Author](URL):
&gt; Text Snippet
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty simple, but it speeds up my <em>micro</em> blogging workflow!</p>
<p>I recorded the <a href="https://cl.ly/oRrv">workflow running on my iPhone</a>, and you can <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/7b8ecf5e3620474ca264d55099b367da">try out the workflow yourself</a></p>
