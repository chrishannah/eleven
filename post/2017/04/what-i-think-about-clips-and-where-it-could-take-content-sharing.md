title: What I Think About Clips and Where It Could Take Content Sharing
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Apple released Clips yesterday, which is their new app for creating fun videos, with various filters, music, and more. I <a href="http://theapp.life/apple-announce-new-clips-app-for-creating-and-sharing-videos/">covered this app before</a>, but as I hadn’t played around with the app at that point, it was literally just explaining the features.</p>
<p>But now I’ve had over a day with the app, and I must say I’m really loving it. It’s even earned it’s place on my Home screen!</p>
<p>The design of the app itself is quite nice, but I’m not sure I feel the same way about the icon. And it just feels easy to use, which I guess is the main focus.</p>
<p>I didn’t think I’d say this, but I also like the filters! The comic book one is by far my favourite, everything looks good in it!</p>

<p>There’s a lot of talk about the usage of private APIs, and how the app itself doesn’t ask for permission to use things like the camera or microphone, but seeing as this is an Apple app, I’m not too worried.</p>
<p>Another thing I like about Clips, is the exporting options. I had wondered how Apple would select social networks that would be included, but using a (completely custom) share sheet, is a good way to avoid any issues. Because this means any app can enable support for Clips, by adding video importing. One option I’m very thankful of, is YouTube, because it’s really fast (and super easy) to upload a Clip, and have it available near instantly.</p>
<p>I had some interesting mail today, and this gave me the opportunity to make use of Clips title features and music. Which I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kYnG4VwHww">turned out pretty well</a>!</p>

<p>Finally, there’s something else I must say about Clips, and the type of app/service it could be enabling. And although the app is purely a way to capture, and edit videos, I think the content that people will create in Clips <em>could</em> change the way people watch videos.</p>
<p>We all know the issues with YouTube, there’s advertisement problems, the creators seem to always be annoyed about something, and it generally lacks competition. But one thing we can take from YouTube, is that people <strong>love</strong> Vlogs. Which are essentially a video version of a blog post, it’s a visual way to understand someone else’s life.</p>
<p>Blogs used to be huge, and while I still really enjoy writing my own, and reading other’s blog posts. But since then, microblogging services have taken over, with Twitter being the main service.</p>
<p>What I’m thinking is, if Twitter took blogging and made it micro, so then more people could take part, and share more content, more often. What if Clips could make vlogging micro? It would need another service of course, but it could just make use of whatever social network they’re on. I personally think that this app, along with competing apps that will no doubt turn up soon, will be the catalyst for upgrading the type of content that is shared.</p>
