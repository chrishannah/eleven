<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>A few days ago I started to use Pinboard, which if you didn&#8217;t know, is a personal archiving service for links/notes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve known about the service for a while now, and it seems to be rather helpful to people, and while finally checking it out, the philosophy behind it really resonated with me. It&#8217;s a paid (only $11 per year) service, that has a huge focus on the actual content that you save, and letting you do whatever you intent to do. Nothing gets in your way.</p>
<p>I was looking into the various different settings of Pinboard, and then of course, had a look at the API. It sort of resurrected the idea in my head, where I would send out a regular newsletter to people, simply containing interesting links from around the web.</p>
<p>So I got creating a workflow, and in about 15 minutes I had a rough draft on a workflow that exported the days links, that featured a certain tag. My idea was I could then use this content in a super minimal email, and send it out at the end of every week.</p>
<p>This then evolved quite a lot, with the workflow being able to ask for user details, and then return the links (still for a specific tag) since a given date. It would then put it in a simple Markdown format, and convert to Rich Text for export purposes. I made a few cleanups, so if you want to try it for yourself, you can <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/817ec456014044e6b5015e9d3ef27085">download my workflow</a>.</p>
<h1 id="thenewsletter">The Newsletter</h1>
<p>Starting this Friday, I will be using my fancy workflow to compile a list of my most interesting (hopefully) links, and send them out that night. I chose Friday, because then there&#8217;s always something to read over the weekend!</p>
