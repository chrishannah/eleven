<p>Welcome to 2017… Panic’s 20th anniversary!!</p>
<p>No, your eyes do not deceive you. Some of you may not know that we founded our company in 1997, but it’s true. We’re older than Facebook, older than Twitter, older than Google, and somehow still kickin’.</p>
<p>Every year is a little different, and last year was for sure — a little bit quieter on the software front (at least publicly), and a whole lot louder on the launch-of-a-major-multi-platform-video-game front.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s time: here’s a look back at 2016, and look forward to 2017.</p>
