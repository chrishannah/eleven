<p>I feel like I post more updates to Text Case here than real blog posts. Oh well, this one I’m blaming Jason Snell. We <a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/1181947973984378880">exchanged a few tweets about Text Case</a>, and he suggested a feature where Text Case could have a list of manually capitalised nouns that would be used when converting text. I immediately saw the benefit of this idea, and started mapping it out in my head.</p>
<p>In just over a day, the update has been developed, and worked its way through Apple’s review process.</p>
<p>It contains what I’m calling the “Custom Dictionary”, and it lets you store words capitalised in a specific way. So that whenever you use Title Case or Sentence Case, these capitalisations have the highest precedence. It’s perfect for brand and product names, and that’s also why I’ve included a few common nouns in the app to start off.</p>
<p>The words themselves are stored in a <code>.json</code> file, which you can find in the Text Case folder in iCloud Drive. This can be edited manually outside Text Case (I would recommend <a href="http://jayson.app">an app called Jayson</a>), and the changes will then be picked up when Text Case is next used.</p>
<p>One more thing, I also added a new dark theme. Previously the dark option had pure black as a main colour, but this is a bit too dark for some people. I’ve renamed that theme to “Black”, and added an option that is a dark grey.</p>
