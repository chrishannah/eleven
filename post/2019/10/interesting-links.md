<p>It&#8217;s time for me to announce a little project I&#8217;m going to start doing alongside this blog. From this Friday, I&#8217;ll be starting a weekly newsletter called &#8220;Interesting Links&#8221;, and as the name suggests, it will be a short list of (around 5) links to interesting things I&#8217;ve found all across the internet.</p>
<p>This is because there are tons of interesting things I find, but I don&#8217;t necessarily want to turn all of them into linked posts here on the blog. So this gives me a chance to share even more of them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep it very minimal, because otherwise I know it won&#8217;t be pleasant to read, and it won&#8217;t be that interesting to write either!</p>
<p>So <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/chrishannah">you can subscribe now</a>, and the first issue will arrive in your inboxes on Friday!</p>
