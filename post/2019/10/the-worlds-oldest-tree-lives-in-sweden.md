title: The World’s Oldest Tree Lives in Sweden
---

<p><a href="https://swedesinthestates.com/the-worlds-oldest-tree-lives-in-sweden/">Elina Sundqvist, on Swedes in the States</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The world’s oldest tree, Old Tjikko, is a 9,500-year-old Norwegian Spruce tree that was discovered in 2004 by Professor Leif Kullman, and to this day remains the world’s oldest tree. The tree is located on Fulufjället, in the province of Dalarna.
