<blockquote><p>
  A flaw that means any fingerprint can unlock a Galaxy S10 phone has been acknowledged by Samsung.</p>
<p>It promised a software patch that would fix the problem.</p>
<p>The issue was spotted by a British woman whose husband was able to unlock her phone with his thumbprint just by adding a cheap screen protector.</p>
<p>When the S10 was launched, in March, Samsung described the fingerprint authentication system as &#8220;revolutionary&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
