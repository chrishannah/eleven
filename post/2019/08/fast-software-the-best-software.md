title: Fast Software, the Best Software
---

<p>Craig Mod wrote a great piece recently about <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/">the speed of software affects the overall perception of quality</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting all the way through, but my favourite paragraph was where he uses a typewriter as an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  A typewriter is an excellent tool because, even though itâ€™s slow in a relative sense, every aspect of the machine itself operates as quickly as the user can move. It is focused. There are no delays when making a new line or slamming a key into the paper. Yes, you have to put a new sheet of paper into the machine at the end of a page, but that action becomes part of the flow of using the machine, and the accumulation of paper a visual indication of work completed. It is not wasted work. There are no fundamental mechanical delays in using the machine.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I find it all resonated with me quite a lot. I have very little patience, and that is a big factor in choosing what software I use.</p>
