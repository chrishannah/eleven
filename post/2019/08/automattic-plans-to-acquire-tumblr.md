<blockquote><p>
  Hello Tumblr ðŸ‘‹</p>
<p>  Today, Tumblrâ€™s owner, Verizon Media, announced that Automattic plans to acquire Tumblr. Automattic is the technology company behind products such as WordPress.com, WooCommerce, Jetpack, and Simplenoteâ€”products that help connect creators, businesses, and publishers to communities around the world.
</p></blockquote>
<p>What a great acquisition. It&#8217;s clear to see the impressive work that Automattic have been doing over the years, and it will be interesting to see what Tumblr will be like in a few years.</p>
