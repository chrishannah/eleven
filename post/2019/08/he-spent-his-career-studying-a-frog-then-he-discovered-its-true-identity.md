title: He Spent His Career Studying a Frog. Then He Discovered Its True Identity
---

<p>I just watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuhDCXYMdTI">a fascinating video by the National Geographic</a>. Where Andrew Gray, a Curator of Herpetology at Manchester Museum, spent years researching the Splendid leaf frog, and later discover something truly surprising about the specimens that have already been collected.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a few twists and turns in the story, and to withhold the pleasure of discovering them as you watch, I&#8217;ve not disclosed any spoilers.</p>
