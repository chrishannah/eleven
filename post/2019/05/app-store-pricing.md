<p><a href="https://beckyhansmeyer.com/2019/05/11/app-store-pricing/">Becky Hansmeyer on pricing an app</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
$5 should be the absolute rock bottom price for a quality indie app, full stop. So, for whoever might need to hear this: stop kidding yourself, youâ€™re not going to make it up in volume, raise your dang prices, thank you and good night.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t class Text Case as some kind of massively featured app, but I recently rose the price of it from its initial price of $1 to $2 with the last 2.0 update. But now I&#8217;m starting to think I should up it to $3.</p>
