title: Managing Instagram Hashtag Sets
---

<p>Jordan Merrick <a href="https://www.jordanmerrick.com/2019/05/managing-instagram-hashtag-sets/">shared some great tips on how you can manage Hashtags for Instagram</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
My iPhone photography workflow includes sharing some of the photos I’ve taken to Instagram. I usually include relevant hashtags to increase discoverability and have a collection of frequently used hashtag sets—different hashtags for the same topic—that I can choose from. I also include a five-dot prefix (each dot on a separate line) to separate the photo’s caption text and hashtags. This is a commonly used method for hiding hashtags “below the fold” so they’re only visible when tapping the more button.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve used specific groups of hashtags before on Instagram, and used a Shortcut to populate the clipboard with them, however these tips are much better than that.</p>
