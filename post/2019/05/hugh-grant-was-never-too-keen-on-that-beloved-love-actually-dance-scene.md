title: Hugh Grant Was Never Too Keen on That Beloved Love Actually Dance Scene
---

<p><a href="http://time.com/5101596/hugh-grant-love-actually-dance/">Raisa Bruner, writing for Time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Hugh Grant is one of our most iconic rom-com leads, often playing a dashing — but hapless — British suitor.</p>
<p>In perennial favorite Love Actually, he achieved perhaps the pinnacle of the form, even going so far as to very winningly dance through the halls of his residence at 10 Downing Street (also known as the prime minister’s home) to the tune of the Pointer Sisters’ “Jump (For My Love).” The spring in his step is all due to love, of course.</p>
<p>But it turns out that the actor wasn’t actually very keen to get his groove on.</p></blockquote>
<p>I certainly read some strange articles. But at leat for myself, this was pretty interesting. I’m not embarrassed at all to say that I’ve watched Love Actually quite a lot of times, and this dance is my favourite scene.</p>
