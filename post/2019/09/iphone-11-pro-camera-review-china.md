title: 'iPhone 11 Pro Camera Review: China'

<blockquote><p>
  I’m here as I continue on-going work photographing The Bach Project w/ Yo-Yo Ma, a world tour where Yo-Yo is performing Bach in unconventional places around the globe. It’s been a privilege to photograph this amazing journey, and when I considered how to test the iPhone 11 Pro’s new capabilities, I thought a shoot on this project could be a great fit as many of these shoots have been in extremely low light!</p>
<p>  Of course, I’ve also been anxious to see what this Ultra Wide lens can do, so shortly after the performance I popped out to the countryside to find some epic landscapes and have been out exploring this big, beautiful country ever since.</p>
<p>  The iPhone 11 Pro announcement was really about one thing: camera. (ICYMI, see this video pretty much summing it up.)</p>
<p>  The big camera features I was most interested in testing were obviously the Ultra Wide (13 mm) lens, the new Night mode, Capture Outside the Frame, and things like iOS 13 photo management, editing tools, etc.

<p>Austin Mann&#8217;s iPhone reviews are one of the few reviews that I read every year. As the main improvements to iPhone over the recent years being the camera, I can&#8217;t think of anyone else to better it all.</p>
<p>And as always, it&#8217;s packed full of great photography. It&#8217;s a must read.</p>
