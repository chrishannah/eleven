title: Text Case 2.0 is Released!
---

<p>It&#8217;s taken a while, but I&#8217;m very glad to announce that <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1407730596?ls=1&amp;mt=8&amp;at=1010l4Hj">Text Case 2.0</a> is finally available!</p>
<p>The reason why it wasn&#8217;t a simple update, is that The app has been completely rebuilt. This includes a new way of organising individual formats into groups, and a new design that fits.</p>
<p>There are four new formats to use: Emoji, Rot13, Base64 Encoded, and Base64 Decoded. This means that there are now 23 different formats to use in Text Case!</p>
<p>The app now has a few extra customisation options, you can switch between a Dark and Light theme, change the order of the groups, enable/disable formats, and also choose between 22 different app icons.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1407730596?ls=1&amp;mt=8&amp;at=1010l4Hj">You can get Text Case on the App Store!</a></p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re interested, you can check out the <a href="https://textcase.app">new Text Case website</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> A series of guides focussed around getting the most out of Text Case will be published regularly. So watch this space!</em></p>
