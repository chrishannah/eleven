<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-47527505">BBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prof Stephen Hawking has been honoured on a new 50p coin inspired by his pioneering work on black holes.</p>
<p>The physicist died last year at the age of 76, having become one of the most renowned leaders in his field.</p>
<p>He joins an elite group of scientists to have appeared on coins, including Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin.</p>
<p>Designer Edwina Ellis said: &#8220;I wanted to fit a big black hole on the tiny coin and wish he was still here chortling at the thought.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve always liked the fact that we place very important people on our money, such as Charles Darwin, James Watt, and Michael Faraday. It signifies their reverence to the entire world.</p>
<p>It also reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An9Y9gzari0">a talk that Neil Degrasse Tyson made at The Tanner Humanities Center</a>, where he spoke about what some countries place on their money, from the perspective of America not having a lot of scientific achievements on theirs.</p>
