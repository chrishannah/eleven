title: My Daily Journal Is No More
---

<p>After just over 6 months, I’m stopping writing my <a href="https://chrishannah.me/category/micro/journal/">daily journal entries</a>.</p>
<p>Originally I was aiming to complete an entire year, and then rethink what I was going to do with it. However, it’s been about a week that I haven’t written a single entry, and surprisingly I’ve been totally fine with it. And as it’s reached the 6-month milestone, it feels like a good time to stop, have some time off, and refocus on the next thing.</p>
<h2>Stats</h2>
<p>Just because I can, here are a few quick stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>183 total entries</li>
<li>30,579 total words</li>
<li>167 averages words per post</li>
</ul>
<p>And some additional graphs:</p>

<h2>What I’ve Learned</h2>
<p>I’ve certainly learned a few things from the process though. Mainly that I like writing and especially personal logs, that I can write down quite easily, without a ton of research.</p>
<p>Something that made it really easy was automation, obviously. I’ve written about my automation before on the blog. First with “<a href="https://chrishannah.me/how-i-automate-my-daily-journal/">How I Automate My Daily Journal</a>”, where I discussed the way I reminded myself to write, and also to generate a new file based upon a template. And also with “<a href="https://chrishannah.me/how-i-automate-publishing-blog-posts/">How I Automate Publishing Blog Posts</a>”, where I go through how I take a markdown file and publish it to the blog.</p>
<p>However, even though it was relatively friction-free to write and publish journal entries to my blog, sometimes it just felt like a chore. Especially when a day was simply too boring to write about, where I was just forcing myself to write <em>something</em>.</p>
<h2>What It Means for the Future</h2>
<p>If I’m going to take anything away from this for the future of this blog, it’s that I enjoy writing about more personal experiences. So while I’m not promising anything, that’s the direction I want to go down.</p>
<p>I also want to combine that with some more photography of mine. I take tons of photos, and I just don’t feel that Instagram is a good place to host all of that. After trips, I’ve shared photos on the blog before, where I select a handful of my favourites, and this is the style I will most likely continue.</p>
<p>But in general, I want this blog to feel more like <em>my blog</em>. I’m steering away from generic tech review and Apple news. Because there are so many good writers covering that stuff already, and I’m fine with reading what they have to say, rather than me repeating most of what’s already out there. So hopefully I can start living up to the appropriately named “Chris Hannah” blog.</p>
