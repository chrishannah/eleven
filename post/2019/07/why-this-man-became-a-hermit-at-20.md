title: Why This Man Became a Hermit at 20

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-48968502">BBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In 1986, 20-year-old Christopher Knight drove into a forest in rural Maine. He abandoned his car, and taking just some very basic camping supplies, simply walked into the woods. He didn&#8217;t come out again for 27 years.</p>
<p>  After getting deliberately lost, Knight eventually found the site that would become his home, a small clearing in the densely wooded area surrounding a lake called North Pond. He stretched some tarpaulin between trees, put up his small nylon tent, and settled down. He was completely hidden, despite being only a few minutes&#8217; walk from one of the hundreds of summer cabins that dotted the area.

<p>My immediate expectation of this article, after reading the headline, was a story about how someone worked their way to having a sustainable living outside in the woods. Turns out, I was wrong, and itâ€™s fascinating in a whole other way!</p>
