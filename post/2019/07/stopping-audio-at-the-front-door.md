title: Stopping Audio at the Front Door
---

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this is a thing that other people do. But I never listen to anything, whether it&#8217;s a podcast, or just music, as I enter my house.</p>
<p>For some strange reason the transition to moving inside while listening to something, just feels a bit <em>dirty</em> to me. Maybe that&#8217;s not the right word, but it has a similar effect.</p>
<p>I used to just turn the volume down as I entered, but that still felt uncomfortable to me. So whatever it is, I always have to pause any audio before opening my door. Luckily I have AirPods, and can just tap the side of one to do this.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s maybe even more strange is that I rarely listen to anything using head/earphones indoors. The only exceptions are when I&#8217;m on a video call for work, and I&#8217;m not alone in the house, or if I have over-ear headphones on while focussing on writing or development. Both rare occasions.</p>
