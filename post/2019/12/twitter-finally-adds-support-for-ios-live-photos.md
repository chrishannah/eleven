title: Twitter Finally Adds Support for iOS Live Photos
---

<p>After four short years, Twitter have added support for Live Photos. A feature that was announced alongside the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, in 2015.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Give the gift of GIFs. You can now upload your iOS Live Photos as GIFs anywhere you upload photos on Twitter. <a href="https://t.co/D8TIfsBwyd">pic.twitter.com/D8TIfsBwyd</a></p>
<p>â€” Twitter (@Twitter) <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1204827212731625473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">11 December 2019</a></p></blockquote>

<p>If you ignore the strangely huge delay, I do think that it&#8217;s a very welcome addition. A lot of people including myself take Live Photos all the time. So I can see this being quite popular.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t literally keep them as Live Photos though, they are converted to GIF format. That&#8217;s not exactly a bad thing though, as I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s quite a few benefits of storing them as a GIF rather than the raw video from the Live Photo.</p>
<p>One thing I didn&#8217;t like about the video alongside their very brief announcement, was the attitude towards the newly added support. They talk about how millions of Live Photos are taken every day, but how they go unshared and forgotten about. But &#8220;Today is a new day&#8221;. Sure, today is a new day and it&#8217;s a pretty cool feature, but I think it easily could have been done a number of years ago. The only blocker for adding this support earlier was Twitter themselves.</p>
