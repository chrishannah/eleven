title: DuckDuckGo Switches to Apple Maps for Location Searches
---

<p>John Voorhees, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/duckduckgo-switches-to-apple-maps-for-location-searches/">writing for MacStories</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, DuckDuckGo, the privacy-focused web search engine, began using Apple Maps for location-based searches. The company, which previously used OpenStreetMap, switched to Apple&#8217;s MapKit JS framework, which Apple introduced at WWDC in June 2018.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very good improvement to DuckDuckGo. Hopefully this kind of integration will also lead to more visibility into any flaws that it may have, which can be rectified once for the entire service. That can only benefit the other platforms Apple Maps is on.</p>
<p>Thinking about DuckDuckGo a bit more, them using Apple maps is probably a very good fit, as I personally see them as the “Apple” of search engines, as they both put a big emphasis on anonymising data requests, and respecting user privacy.</p>
<p>What I want to see next, is DuckDuckGo become the <strong>default</strong> option on iOS. But as Google already pay a ton of money for this, I don’t see it as being <em>that</em> likely.</p>
