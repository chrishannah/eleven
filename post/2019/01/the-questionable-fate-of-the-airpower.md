title: The Questionable Fate of the AirPower
---

<p>David Sparks had an <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2019/1/the-questionable-fate-of-the-airpower">interesting take on AirPower</a>, that maybe not many people actually care about it. But also that it would be good to end all the rumours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope Apple does perfect and ship the AirPower, if for no other reason, so we can start talking about it. Regardless, I can’t help but think in the overall scheme of things, AirPower is small potatoes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe this is why Apple haven’t came out at any point with updates to the availability of it. They have had real issues with AirPower, like the heat caused by placing so many charging coils together. But there’s been <em>zero</em> news about it since the announcement, at least officially. Maybe because it’s just an accessory that only a tiny fraction of people will get, so it’s not actually a big deal.</p>
