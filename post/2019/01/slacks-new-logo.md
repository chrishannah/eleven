title: Slack’s New Logo
---

<p>Slack has today <a href="https://slackhq.com/say-hello-new-logo">announced their new logo on their blog</a>. It was designed between Slack and <a href="https://www.pentagram.com/">Pentagram</a>, and the result is a relatively flavourless icon, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I for one, and I think many others, associate the colourful octothorpe logo with Slack. And also their plaid pattern that is used in many places.</p>
<p>The opinion that I’ve seen best match mine, is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/01/16/slack-bland-new-logo">John Gruber over at Daring Fireball</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Slack’s old identity had at least three good things going for it: they owned the letter “S” (much like how Netflix owns “N” — something Netflix has doubled-down on as their identity has evolved), they owned the “#” hash mark, and unique among technology companies, they owned plaid. When you saw plaid with those primary colors on a white background, you thought Slack. And plaid isn’t part of any sort of design trend right now. Slack simply owned plaid, to such a degree that Slack company socks — which simply used colors and plaid, no “Slack”, no “S” were necessary to make it instantly obvious these were Slack socks — became coveted swag.</p></blockquote>
<p>When the Slack iOS app installed on my phone, I instantly forgot where I put it. Sure, it only took a few seconds, but the old logo seemed to draw you in. It had a colourful border, with a bright white background, and the typical “S” that you see with Slack. But now it’s a slightly dull purple, with a generic colourful icon on top. It just blends in.</p>
<p>It feels very much like change for the sake of change, which is exactly what Slack’s blog post said it <em>wasn’t</em>.</p>
