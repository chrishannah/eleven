title: Text Case Can Clap for You Now! 👏
---

<p>A few days a go, <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewc13/status/1134112979413282818">a friend on Twitter said to me</a> that Text Case needed to support clap case. This being the replacement of spaces between words with a clapping hands emoji. 👏</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve never thought about adding it to Text Case before. I&#8217;ve seen it tons of times used on Twitter, and it&#8217;s not exactly a hard format to code.</p>
<p>So I did it.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take long at all. And it&#8217;s a features designed just for fun. But in version 2.1, you 👏 can 👏 now 👏 clap 👏 away 👏 to 👏 your 👏 hearts 👏 content.</p>
