title: The UK Home Office Accidentally Shared Personal Email Addresses of 240 EU Citizens
---

<p>The Home Office are the people who deal with EU citizens requests seeking for settled status in the UK (among other things, of course), but it appears they made a bit of a mistake when sending emails to some of them asking to resubmit their information:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Home Office sent the email on Sunday 7 April asking applicants, who had already struggled with technical problems, to resubmit their information.</p>
<p>But it failed to use the &#8220;blind CC&#8221; box on the email, revealing the details of other applicants.</p>
<p>In another message apologising to those who had been affected, the Home Office wrote: &#8220;The deletion of the email you received from us on 7 April 2019 would be greatly appreciated.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47888214">Ross Hawkins, BBC</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, someone doesn&#8217;t know the difference between CC and BCC, and now the department may have to make an apology in Parliament. Along with the fact that they breached the Data Protection Act.</p>
