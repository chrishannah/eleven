title: Reeder Is Back and Better than Ever
---

<p>When I heard about Reeder 4 being released, I wasn’t quite sure what benefits it had over Reeder 3. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/reeder-4/">Matthew Casinelli wrote a great piece</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>iPad users who have been holding out hope for an update to Reeder for iOS can relax – a new version was released today with full support for all devices on all platforms and some interesting new features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading the full article, you’ll have no surprise that I ended up purchasing the app.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id1449412357?at=1010l4Hj">Reeder 4 on the App Store</a>.</p>
