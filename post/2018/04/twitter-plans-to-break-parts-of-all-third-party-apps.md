title: Twitter Plans to Break Parts of All Third-party Apps
---

<p><a href="http://apps-of-a-feather.com/">And some of the developers have responded</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After June 19th, 2018, “streaming services” at Twitter will be removed. This means two things for third-party apps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Push notifications will no longer arrive</li>
<li>Timelines won’t refresh automatically &#8211; <a href="http://apps-of-a-feather.com/">apps-of-a-feather.com</a></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Twitter has always had a strange relationship with developers of third-party clients, with certain features never even making it into their hands. A quick example would be Polls. They don’t show up on apps like Tweetbot, because they don’t know they exist.</p>
<p>I’m not so sure how much of a loss timeline streaming would be, but push notifications?!</p>
