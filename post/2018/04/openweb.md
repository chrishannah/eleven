<p>Michael Rockwell, writer for <a href="http://initialcharge.net/">Initial Charge</a>, has come up with a fantastic new project, <a href="http://hashtagopenweb.net">#OpenWeb</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I spent a few days over the past week working on a little project that’s been bouncing around in my head lately. I’ve wanted something like this to exist for years and with the skills I’ve obtained from Treehouse over the past several months, I thought it was finally time to build it myself. Today, I’d like to announce #OpenWeb.</p>
<p>The site aggregates headlines from independent publishers that focus on Apple products and software. It also serves as a directory of single-person weblogs within our community. Over the past few years, social networks have become less and less exciting to use and there have been some subtle indications that the open web is poised for a comeback. With Micro.blog, JSON Feed, the meteoric rise in podcasting, and the frustration that many of us have had with Twitter and Facebook — I think weblogs could be the next big thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea of a place to discover new bloggers, and to help push more independent writers (like myself), has always been something I’d liked to have.</p>
<p>There are 16 sources currently being fed into #OpenWeb, and I’m sure this will grow and be refined over time. But along with the combined feed of posts from these blogs, you can also find an <code>.OPML</code> file, which will allow you to add all of them to your RSS reader of your choice.</p>
<p>Obviously, I’m massively grateful that I was included as one of the sources! I’ll have to pay that back by trying to write better, and more often.</p>
