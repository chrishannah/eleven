title: 'Slate Development Log #2'
---

<p>As you may have realised, development on Slate, my Micro.blog client for iOS, hasn’t really been going anywhere recently.</p>
<p>I’ve been meaning to just get a very early build on TestFlight for a while now. Simply so people can have early access, and see how it feels for them as I progress.</p>
<p>However, since my <a href="https://chrishannah.me/slate-development-log/">first development log</a>, I’ve spent most of the time trying to optimise the code and nothing that adds any features to the app. And at the same time, the only things I had left on my plan for the first beta version, was just some icons. So I’ve lost a long time, simply because I’ve been procrastinating about creating a few images.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-15-at-20.30.56-1.png" alt="Tab Bar" /></p>
<p>I’m sure everyone will be pleased that, I’ve created some icons for the menu, and the tab bar at the bottom of the app. I did also plan to make an app icon, but this is really going to hold the project back because I simply can’t be bothered to make one yet.</p>
<p>So, right now I’m going to start all the boring procedures for getting the app set up iTunes connect, and then getting a build to TestFlight.</p>
<p>If you want immediate access to the first beta, then all I’ll need is an email address. Feel free to <a href="mailto:me@chrishannah.me?Subject=Slate%20Beta">email me</a>, or find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://micro.blog/chrishannah">Micro.blog</a>. Everyone’s welcome.</p>
<p>You’ve just got to remember, that it is <em>super</em> in development.</p>
