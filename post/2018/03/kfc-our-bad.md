title: KFC - “Our Bad” 🐔
---

<p>Recently, here in the UK, the chicken fast-food restaurant KFC were being forced to shut down restaurants for not having enough chicken. It’s completely laughable.</p>
<p>The way KFC dealt with the issue however, is pure brilliance.</p>
<p>They put an ad in the national newspaper:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="961" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1169" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DWtfYbKW4AApbPI.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.chrishannah.me/images/2018/03/DWtfYbKW4AApbPI.jpg 750w, https://cdn.chrishannah.me/images/2018/03/DWtfYbKW4AApbPI-234x300.jpg 234w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>And they also <a href="https://www.kfc.co.uk/crossed-the-road">created website for the issue</a>, named “Crossed The Road”. Where you can track the progress of your local store, and even sign up to their members club for a little reward for when your restaurant does open back up.</p>
<p>They’ve certainly made the most out of a bad situation.</p>
