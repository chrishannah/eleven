---

<p>China have a water problem. Their solution:</p>
<blockquote><p>China is testing cutting-edge defence technology to develop a powerful yet relatively low-cost weather modification system to bring substantially more rain to the Tibetan plateau, Asia’s biggest freshwater reserve.</p>
<p>The system, which involves an enormous network of fuel-burning chambers installed high up on the Tibetan mountains, could increase rainfall in the region by up to 10 billion cubic metres a year – about 7 per cent of China’s total water consumption – according to researchers involved in the project.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if the clouds will have “Made in China” printed on the bottom of them.</p>
