title: New Research Features Coming to Pokémon GO
---

<p><a title="Straight from the Pokémon GO blog:" href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/research-mew-in-pokemon-go/">Straight from the Pokémon GO blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>New objectives lead to exciting rewards and perhaps a Mythical encounter in the latest Pokémon GO update.</p></blockquote>
<p>A somewhat of a surprising (at least to me) update for Pokémon GO has been announced. It’s based around research, and it will add a whole new layer to the game.</p>
<p>All Pokémon Masters will already know about Pokémon research, and how prevalent it is in the games and television shows. But if you don’t, then ask yourself what Professor Oak was up to.</p>
<p>The update will bring two types of research, Field Research and Special Research.</p>
<p>With Field Research being the more regular of the two activities, which will result in rewards, and occasionally a stamp. Which is essentially an achievement. After you collect seven of these, you will achieve a “Research Breakthrough”, which may lead to encounters with legendary Pokémon.</p>
<p>The Special Research is story-based, and will be completed via Professor Willow. This is what I’m more interested in. The current story looks like it’s based around Mew, and the and mysteries behind it. I’m guessing this will be spread out over time, and will maybe mean people will start playing more regularly.</p>
<p>I just hope this leads to the ability to catch Mew.</p>
<p>We’ll just have to see, when the update launches on the 30th March.</p>
