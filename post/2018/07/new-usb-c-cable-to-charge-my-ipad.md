title: New USB C cable to charge my iPad
---

<p>I didn&#8217;t want to purchase a 30w USB C charger and Lightning cable just to charge my iPad. But I since realised that I can actually use my MacBooks USB C charger without any issues, so I found <a href="https://amzn.to/2JF2iiL">this little USB C to Lightning cable on Amazon</a>!<br />
£29.98 originally, but currently £20 off!</p>
