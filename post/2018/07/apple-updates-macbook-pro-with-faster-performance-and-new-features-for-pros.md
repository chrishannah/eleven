title: Apple updates MacBook Pro with faster performance and new features for pros
---

<p>Well this is unexpected, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/07/apple-updates-macbook-pro-with-faster-performance-and-new-features-for-pros/">Apple have updated some of their Macs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cupertino, California — Apple today updated MacBook Pro with faster performance and new pro features, making it the most advanced Mac notebook ever. The new MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar feature 8th-generation Intel Core processors, with 6-core on the 15-inch model for up to 70 percent faster performance and quad-core on the 13-inch model for up to two times faster performance — ideal for manipulating large data sets, performing complex simulations, creating multi-track audio projects or doing advanced image processing or film editing. &#8211; Apple Newsroom</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The improvements are to the 13” and 15” models of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, and there are also a few extra bits of news. I thought I&#8217;d try and extract the key improvements:</p>
<h2>MacBook Pros</h2>
<h3> Hardware</h3>
<ul>
<li>Faster CPUs &#8211; Now using 8th generation chips:
<ul>
<li>Quad-core Intel i5 and i7 processors up to 2.7GHz (Turbo Boost to 4.5GHz) for the 13”</li>
<li>Hexa-core Intel i7 and i9 processors up to 2.9GHz (Turbo Boost to 4.8GHz) for the 15”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Up to 32GB of DDR4 memory in the 15”</li>
<li>New HDD options &#8211; 2TB for the 13” ad 4TB for the 15”</li>
<li>New Apple T2 Chip</li>
<li>True Tone</li>
<li>Upgraded graphics chips:
<ul>
<li>Intel Iris Plus 655 for the 13”</li>
<li>Radeon Pro chips with 4GB of video memory for the 15”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The 13” model now ships with 4 USB C ports</li>
<li>The keyboard has been replaced with a new 3rd generation butterfly keyboard, which is quieter, and maybe more reliable.</li>
<li>Battery capacities have been slightly increased to cope with the newer specs. However, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/12/the-new-macbook-pro-keyboards-are-quieter-but-otherwise-unchanged/">Brian Heater at TechCrunch says that no mechanical changes have been made</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software</h3>
<ul>
<li>“Hey Siri” comes to the MacBook Pro because of the new T2 chip.</li>
<li>Also, enhanced security with secure booting, and on-the-fly storage encryption because of the T2.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Extras</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are new colour options for the MacBook Leather Sleeve (13” and 15”) &#8211; Saddle Brown, Midnight Blue, and Black.</li>
<li>These MacBook Pro’s are also part of the Back to Schoo program, where students can receive a free pair of Beats headphones with eligible Macs.</li>
</ul>
