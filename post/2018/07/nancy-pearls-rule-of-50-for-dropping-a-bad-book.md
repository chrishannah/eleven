title: Nancy Pearl's Rule of 50 for dropping a bad book
---

<p>Nancy Pearl, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/nancy-pearls-rule-of-50-for-dropping-a-bad-book/article565170/">writing for The Globe and Mail</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I became an adult, and a librarian, that I began to question my commitment to finishing each and every book that I began. Now that I really was living a major portion of my life in the library, I literally found myself surrounded by books, tempting me, calling to me from the shelves. How could I &#8211; in one lifetime &#8211; ever get through everything I wanted to read if I had to finish those books that I discovered to be (at least to me) boring, badly written or just plain bad?</p>
<p>It dawned on me that maybe, just maybe, I didn&#8217;t have to finish every book I started. Gradually my attitude changed, but not without a struggle. I felt bad for the authors whose books I gave up on. Didn&#8217;t they deserve a full chance to entice me into the world they&#8217;d created? I could hear their voices in my head, like the voice of my conscience, saying, &#8220;Wait, wait, it gets better! You haven&#8217;t gotten to the good part yet.&#8221; Oh the guilt, the guilt!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very good tip if you want to read more books. I noticed myself that I would become stuck on a boring book, and I wouldn’t allow myself to read anything else. And that really messes things up.</p>
<p>  So now, I just put a book down whenever I’m bored of it, and then pick it back up when I am. It certainly makes my “Reading” section in GoodReads look rather packed, but it’s a good problem to have.</p>
