title: Pokémon GO Becomes One with Nature
---

<p>From <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-go-becomes-one-with-nature/">the Pokémon Company</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Don&#8217;t miss the epic new Pokémon GO trailer created in the style of a nature documentary, featuring Pokémon that have recently begun appearing near you in Pokémon GO.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The video is narrated by iconic actor and comedian Stephen Fry, with his dulcet tones complemented by an original symphonic score by legendary composer George Fenton.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This could quite possibly be one of the best game trailers ever.</p>
