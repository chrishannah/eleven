title: My New Favourite Game - Alto’s Odyssey
---

<p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/altos-odyssey/id1182456409?mt=8&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=MAC">Alto’s Odyssey</a> (the sequel of <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/altos-adventure/id950812012?at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=MAC&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8">Alto’s Adventure</a>) a lot recently, and it’s quickly become my go-to game no matter my situation.</p>
<p>I’ve read some reviews about the game already, and it appears that everyone on the internet has something good to say about it. I can only add to that.</p>
<p>The whole game is quite a mix, in that it’s very relaxing, while requiring your complete focus. And also having a potentially very long game time, while offering short term goals.</p>
<p>I find it very easy to be sucked into, and it’s a great game to take your mind away from other things. The achievements and Game Center leaderboards help my own competitiveness, and I really want to move up in the Best Score category. As of the time writing this, I’m ranked 11,157 with 65,065 points. But at the same time, I also enjoy playing it when I short bursts of free time, such as commuting to work, or just between other tasks.</p>
<p>Apart from the gameplay, the game is a really immersive environment. With ambient music, relaxing sounds, and super colourful settings. It’s enjoyable to just look at the thing.</p>
