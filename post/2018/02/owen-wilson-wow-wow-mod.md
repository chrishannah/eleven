title: Owen Wilson "Wow" Wow Mod
---

<p>I think anybody that has seen Owen Wilson, can hear him saying “Wow” in his voice. Well, some kind developers have taken various clips of this, and <a href="https://wago.io/SyUqO2DbM">created a mod</a> for World of Warcraft, and used them to replace various sounds in the game.</p>
