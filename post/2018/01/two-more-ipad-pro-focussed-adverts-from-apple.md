title: Two More iPad Pro Focussed Adverts From Apple
---

<p>Apple today, launched two more videos focussed on the iPad Pro to their YouTube channel.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOZWPGESVcs">Augement Reality</a></p>
<blockquote><p>With iPad Pro + iOS 11, you can use augmented reality to literally transform the world around you. Your next computer might not be a computer.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrE7VCClWk0">Take Notes</a></p>
<blockquote><p>With iPad Pro + iOS 11, you can use Apple Pencil to create multimedia notes. Draw, type, or drag and drop your favorite photos from Files. Your next computer might not be a computer.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m really enjoying their latest series of iOS 11 videos. It’s not a simple, an iPad is better than a Mac argument. Instead, they tend to focus on a younger user that has no concept of <em>”a computer”</em>, but treat an iPad as <strong>the</strong> device.</p>
<p>It’s starting to become even more apparent, that younger generations are the ones that are truly adapting to new technology. Mainly because they haven’t got the burden of really knowing what it was like before these new devices, such as the iPad Pro.</p>
