<p>Big Cats is a new documentary series, being produced by the BBC. They have an incredible track record with documentaries, especially ones focussed on nature. As proved by the recent Planet Earth II and Blue Planet II series.</p>
<p>This series follows in the same footsteps, as it is being pushed by a new generation of advanced camera technology, and techniques. Which enables them to get some pretty impressive shots of evasive cat species, such as the Snow Leopard, and the Rusty Spotted-Cat.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p05q59zk/big-cats-series-1-episode-1">first episode is already out</a>, and it&#8217;s great! The scenes were impressive, the amount of knowledge about the different species was incredible, and it was just generally intriguing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve also heard about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusty-spotted_cat">Rusty Spotted-Cat</a>, which is the smallest cat species, and grows to between 35 to 48 cm in length, and a 15 to 30 cm tail. They released a small clip from the first episode, so you can watch that below, or on YouTube.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure how they can really make the next episode better than the first, but I expect it will go beyond my expectations. Although it is only a three-episode series, so I guess it will also be pretty packed!</p>
