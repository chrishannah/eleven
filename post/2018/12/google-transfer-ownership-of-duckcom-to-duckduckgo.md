title: Google Transfer Ownership of Duck.com to DuckDuckGo

<blockquote>
<p>Recently, Jamie Zoch (@Yofie) questioned whether search engine DuckDuckGo had acquired the Duck.com domain name from Google.</p>
<p>Search giant Google acquired the Duck.com domain name in 2010 with the acquisition of On2, a video codec company.</p>
<p>Today, DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg confirmed to me that the Duck.com domain name had been transferred to DuckDuckGoâ€™s possession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe they paid them for the domain, or maybe this was Google doing something nice? Who knows.</p>
