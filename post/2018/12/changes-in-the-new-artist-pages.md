title: Changes to Social Features on Apple Music
---

<p>Apple have <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206651">announced some changes to the Artists Pages in Apple Music for iOS</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple Music in iOS 12 makes it easier to browse an artist&#8217;s catalog and discover new music to play. You&#8217;ll find the following changes in the new Artist Pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved Organization: Artist Pages are now better organized to make it easier to find the music you’re looking for, including Essential Albums and a featured release at the top of each artist&#8217;s page.</li>
<li>Personalized Artist Radio: Every Apple Music artist now has their own radio station. Press ▶︎ at the top of any Artist Page to start listening to music from across an artist’s catalog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Connect posts from artists are no longer supported.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Apple Music Connect is no more. Not exactly a big loss in my opinion though.</p>
<p>My opinions are similar to <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-music-connect-shuts-down/">Nick Heer of Pixel Envy</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Aside from Connect, I think Apple Music’s social features have been fairly successful. I check out what the users I follow have been listening to all the time in the For You section, and I like the new Friends Mix added a few months ago. I’ve even noticed a better selection of user-created playlists. I would love to see continued investment and promotion of these more passive social features, rather than another attempt to create a Twitter-but-for-music social network.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can’t say I regularly check what my friends are listening to, but I too have been finding a lot more user-created playlists. And I’ve noticed that playlists that I have created have been getting more attention from others.</p>
<p>Receiving updates from artists in Apple Music always seemed a bit odd to me, as I never really thought any artists would spend much time creating content for a limited outlet such as Apple Music. Especially as they surely knew it wouldn’t be <em>that</em> popular.</p>
<p>What I do want to see more of though, are social features designed for the listeners. With things like user-curated playlists, and smarter recommendations that take into consideration your interests, your friends, what’s trending in a certain area, etc. I’ve always found Spotify to be much better at this, and discoverability in general. And I’d much prefer Apple to compete on that front, instead of trying to attract Artists to be social on a music platform.</p>
