<p>I&#8217;ve done enough for v0.4 of Slate I think, so I&#8217;ll upload that to TestFlight now. And then I can start working composing for v0.5!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the raw release notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vertical spacing in the post cell, and also separating them has been adjusted.</li>
<li>Names are now slightly bold, with the username being less distinguished.</li>
<li>Inline images now load for urls with https.</li>
<li>Fix scenario where login fields would not adapt properly to the keyboard height.</li>
<li>If you view your own profile/author view, it will hide the follow button.</li>
<li>Inline images are resized vertically, if they are in landscape orientation. However they will not be resized vertically as that could lead to a very bad reading experience.</li>
<li>Tapping anywhere on a cell for an author will now open their profile.</li>
<li>The Favourite and Conversation swipe actions now have images.</li>
<li>Started localising the text for US english.</li>
<li>Fixed relative dates being completely inaccurate! </li>
</ul>
