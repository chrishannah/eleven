<blockquote>
<p>Being able to generate power will be essential for long-term space travel. Powering a stay on Mars, for example, will require a lot of fuel, way more than we can pack onto a rocket. That&#8217;s why NASA, Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Department of Energy and a number of other groups have been working on a small, transportable nuclear reactor that can reliably generate power on the go. The reactor they&#8217;re developing is called Kilopower and earlier this year, they announced that they had conducted successful tests of the system. In March, the team ran the first full-power tests and during a press conference today, they reported that those tests went extremely well.</p>
<p>Lower power Kilopower systems, like the one kilowatt version, can power a basic toaster, while the largest version, a 10 kilowatt model, can do a bit more. Four or five of the latter could be used to power a habitat on Mars and importantly, they don&#8217;t rely on the sun, meaning they can be used on planets with less sunlight than ours, in shadowed regions and during light-blocking dust storms. &#8220;Kilopower&#8217;s compact size and robustness allows us to deliver multiple units on a single lander to the surface that provides tens of kilowatts of power,&#8221; NASA Associate Administrator Steve Jurczyk said in January.</p>

<p>It’s certainly not Iron Man’s Arc reactor, but this is still pretty cool! </p>
