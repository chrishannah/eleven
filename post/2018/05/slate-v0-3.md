<p>It&#8217;s time for me to push another beta version of Slate!</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn&#8217;t complete everything in my plan for this version. But versions don&#8217;t really mean anything at the minute, as it&#8217;s probably better for the whole process if I just release more often.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the raw release notes for this build:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added pull to refresh on the profile and author views.</li>
<li>Profiles and author views now have the name as the title.</li>
<li>Times on posts are now relative.</li>
<li>Links are no longer underlined.</li>
<li>Instead of verifying the app token every time the app is launched, it moves straight to the timeline, and checks in the background.</li>
<li>There are now no separators in the post tables.</li>
<li>The light theme is slightly lighter.</li>
<li>The menu adapts to the theme as well now.</li>
<li>Fixed the issue where some tables were not getting their background colour changed when a new theme is selected.</li>
<li>Line height is now slightly bigger.</li>
<li>You favourite posts now by swiping from left -> right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to get in touch about joining the beta, it&#8217;s compltely open to everyone.</p>
