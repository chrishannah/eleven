title: Update to the Apple/Valve Situation
---

<p>A short update regarding <a href="http://micro.chrishannah.me/2018/05/25/apple-and-valves.html">my earlier piece on Apple blocking Steam&#8217;s Steam Link app</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out I was correct in that the type of app has nothing to do with the rejection. Which is why the appeal to Apple about there already being other remote-desktop style apps, didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-apple-steam/apple-blocks-steams-plan-to-extend-its-video-games-to-iphones-idUKKCN1IQ09D">Reuters wrote a great piece</a>, including quotes from Valve. The major point is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam, however, also offers purchases within games distributed through its platform and also takes a cut of those purchases. Apple’s App Store guidelines ban such a store-within-a-store unless the purchases flow the Apple’s infrastructure and pay Apple’s cut.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>That</strong> is why it was rejected.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also the reason why you have a Kindle app on iOS, but have to go to the Amazon website to purchase books. Because they don&#8217;t want to share any revenue with Apple.</p>
<p>It may seem terrible that Apple demand a cut of all purchases made on their platform. But they are the ones supplying the platform, and the opportunity for developers to build apps for them.</p>
