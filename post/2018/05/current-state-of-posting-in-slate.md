title: Current state of posting in Slate
---

<p>I recently started working on one of the most important parts of Slate, composing and publishing posts.</p>
<p>It was maybe the <em>only</em> feature I actually planned out, and I have a whole section in Things dedicated to it. I already know what features I want to add before I can say it’s complete, but I think I will also release a beta version for this feature, as soon as the minimal tasks are completed.</p>
<p>At the moment, it’s quite basic in functionality. It accepts an optional title, and of course the list content. No replies, image uploading, etc.</p>
<p>The first step was, of course, to add the code to actually post something to Micro.blog. But since then I’ve just been working on the UI.</p>
<p>Again, that is quite simple. There’s a field with for the title, a much larger text field which is where I’m currently writing this post content, and also a character count in the bottom-right corner.</p>
<p>Before releasing a beta version of composing, there are just a few things I want to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Markdown highlighting.</li>
<li>Easy way to insert Markdown syntax, such as links, or italics.</li>
<li>Replying to a post.</li>
<li>Replying to a user straight from their profile.</li>
</ul>
<p>After I’ve done that, another build will be released!</p>
