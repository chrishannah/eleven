title: Facebook Are Building a “Clear History” Feature
---

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104899855107881">Mark Zuckerberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today at our F8 conference I&#8217;m going to discuss a new privacy control we&#8217;re building called &#8220;Clear History&#8221;.</p>
<p>In your web browser, you have a simple way to clear your cookies and history. The idea is a lot of sites need cookies to work, but you should still be able to flush your history whenever you want. We&#8217;re building a version of this for Facebook too. It will be a simple control to clear your browsing history on Facebook &#8212; what you&#8217;ve clicked on, websites you&#8217;ve visited, and so on.</p>

<p>Seems pretty reasonable. Nothing amazing about it though, of course you should be able to clear your history.</p>
<p>However, just a few paragraphs below, his true lizard-self comes out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be clear, when you clear your cookies in your browser, it can make parts of your experience worse. You may have to sign back in to every website, and you may have to reconfigure things. The same will be true here. Your Facebook won&#8217;t be as good while it relearns your preferences.</p>
