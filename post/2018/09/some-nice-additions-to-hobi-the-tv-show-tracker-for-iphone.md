title: Some Nice Additions to Hobi the TV Show Tracker for iPhone
---

<p>Just as I started using Hobi to track the TV shows I watch, they released a pretty impressive update!</p>

<p>There’s now a new Discover and Statistics section, which really round out the entire app.</p>
<p>In Discover, you can find popular shows by genre or service. Along with collections for what’s currently trending, and also any new or returning shows that are coming this week or month.</p>
<p>The Statistics page shows you some insight on what TV shows you watch. You can see the total time you’ve spent watching TV, how many series, episodes, and also things like what your favourite genre is.</p>
<p>I’m going to start going through all the series that I’ve watched recently and add them to Hobi. I can imagine I’ll have some big numbers in the statistics section.</p>
