title: iOS 12 Release Day
---

<p>Yesterday was iOS 12 release day, and it was a pretty good day overall, so I thought I’d share some of my personal highlights.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/ios-12/">iOS 12</a> and the new <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8">Shortcuts app</a> was released, so it was good to see everyone discover the new features that some of us developers and beta users have been playing around with for a while.</p>
<p>I released version 1.3 of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1407730596">Text Case</a> which includes support for Siri Shortcuts. It was <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/text-case-adds-siri-shortcut-support-for-text-transformations/">covered by John Voorhees at MacStories</a>, which was great! And it was met with a good response from quite a lot of people. It’s by far my favourite app I’ve developed, and it’s been super fun seeing where I can integrate the functionality of Text Case throughout the system.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there’s the annual event for nearly everyone in the Apple community, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-12-the-macstories-review/">Federico Viticci’s iOS review</a>! He puts so much work into it, and you can always see that when you read it. This year it’s packed with some great Siri Shortcuts information and even more if you’re a <a href="https://club.macstories.net/?utm_source=ms&amp;utm_medium=header">Club MacStories member</a> (which I am!).</p>
<p>There was also a bunch of other apps that released updates with support for Siri Shortcuts, this was great to see from a developer and user perspective. My favourites so far are <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcalc/id284666222?mt=8">PCalc</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1016366447?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Bear</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ulysses/id1225571038?mt=8">Ulysses</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/apple-store/id469463298?mt=8">Citymapper</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/overcast/id888422857?mt=8">Overcast</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/carrot-weather/id961390574?mt=8">CARROT Weather</a>, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8">Things</a>. And now that password managers can integrate properly into iOS, I’m also going to look at using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8">1Password</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id324613447">LastPass</a>, or even one of the many others that have been updated</p>
<p>The best part of the day was probably Twitter, and while it hasn’t received a lot of praise recently, the Apple community is a major reason why I can’t see myself stopping using it. Everyone was happy about the updates, there was a bunch of conversations about Shortcuts, and generally everyone having a good time! I even made a <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah/status/1041771905605357569">little snark about Mastodon users</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/pschiller/status/1041759544626442240">Phil Schiller even shared some unfortunate news about the Squirrel from the 4S Introduction event</a>.</p>
<p>Now I just need to wait until my XS arrives on Friday, so I can try out the parts of iOS that I’ve been missing. Like Animoji, Memoji, Portrait Lighting, the new Depth Control, and even FaceID!</p>
