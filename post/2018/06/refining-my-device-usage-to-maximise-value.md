title: Refining My Device Usage to Maximise Value
---

<p>With iOS 12’s imminent announcement, I thought I’d prepare myself for a new way of using my devices.</p>
<p>For months now, I’ve been trying to refine my use of my devices, apps, and services that I use. But I think a different approach is needed, and I hope that future OS updates will help me along the way.</p>
<p>The method I’ve been using for a while is quite a harsh one, where I disabled notifications, and everything associated with them, on nearly all applications. Along with getting rid of some apps/services that I don’t think provide any value.</p>
<p>But while I think this has been a step in the right direction, I don’t think it’s a particularly accurate way to achieve my goal of adapting my devices to <em>my</em> needs, and for it to provide me with the most value as possible.</p>
<p>That’s why I’ve now done a complete reversal and turned on <strong>all</strong> the notifications, and possible distractions on my iPhone. In the short term, I’m hoping this will let me find out where I <em>don’t</em> need to be spending my time and also see if there is any value to them. I mean, I know notifications can be valuable, but I want the right balance. And by turning them all off, I’m potentially missing out.</p>
<p>So tonight, I’ve already gone through a few apps to disable types of notifications, and in some cases, just deleted the app entirely. For example, I have an app for a restaurant I go to maybe once every two months, but they send at least one offer notification every single day.</p>
<p>What I’m majorly hoping for in the next iOS update, are pretty minor things. With the ability to group notifications having the highest priority. I can’t even bear thinking about the types of apps that would benefit from this, because it’s probably all of them. I also think there can be improvements made to the way notifications are visualised. Because even grouped, it’s still just a list.</p>
<p>Then there’s priority, not all bits of information are equally useful. And if they are, you might not need to know about it right now. Things like iMessages are more important than likes on an Instagram post, and work emails are certainly not relevant out of work hours, or maybe even a work location. So there’s a lot of work that can be done here, involving sorting, filtering, and queueing/snoozing.</p>
<p>If all of these issues are <em>“resolved”</em>, then I think the way devices are experience, and even used, will change quite a lot.</p>
<p>There’s also one more tool that would be able to help focus your device usage on a bigger scale, and that would be a way to monitor/visualise your usage, or habits, system-wide. Of course, you can kind of track this by using the battery analytics that tells you the time on screen for apps, but I want it better, and more in my face. Because more insight can only be better.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a long-term goal, and maybe more of a process. But I plan to write about my journey of focusing my usage of devices, and in general, refining my life to maximise value.</p>
<p>I have a few more ideas that I want to try soon, so you’ll find these here only blog as well.</p>
