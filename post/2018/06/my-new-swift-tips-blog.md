title: My New Swift Tips Blog
---

<p>Regarding my ramblings yesterday about starting a new blog for swift development tips, I&#8217;ve decided I will host it on my main blog.</p>
<p>However, it is a separate category, that is excluded from the main feeds. There&#8217;s still a link in the navigation bar though.</p>
<p>The first post is <em>super</em> simple, and the actual tip is 1 line of code. It&#8217;s <a href="https://chrishannah.me/hiding-extra-separators-on-a-uitableview/">how to hide extra separators on a UITableView</a>.</p>
<p>I may try and work out a schedule for regular posts, but it may just be slightly sporadic. It&#8217;s not going to be full of big tutorials though, I&#8217;d rather just share small tips for now.</p>
