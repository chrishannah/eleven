title: Endangered Tiger Cubs Born at ZSL Whipsnade Zoo
---

<p>My local zoo Whispnade, has some incredible news about some of their recent additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The as-yet unsexed cubs were born to seven year-old Amur tigress Naya, on Saturday 23 June, after 108 days of pregnancy, and only 121 days (four months) after meeting dad Botzman.</p>
<p>Keepers at the UK’s largest Zoo were anxiously monitoring second-time mum Naya using remote camera technology as she gave birth to the first tiger cub at 7.25pm, and were then elated to see her give birth to three further cubs over the subsequent five hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is pretty impressive to say that there about 500 Amur tigers left in the wild, and Whipsnade have now managed to add 4 to the overall population.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://youtu.be/kie2QGCH-yk">small video of the cubs</a>:</p>
