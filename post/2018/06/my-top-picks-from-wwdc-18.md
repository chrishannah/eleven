title: My Top Picks From WWDC 18
---

<p>After watching the Keynote, I was thoroughly impressed. While there still isn’t a dark mode for iOS, I can imagine it coming soon. And there are a lot of cool things that were announced.</p>
<p>While watching the event, I took a note of the top 4 for each OS, excluding tvOS, because who cares?</p>
<p>So here they are:</p>
<p><strong>iOS 12</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Siri Shortcuts</li>
<li>Notifications</li>
<li>Screen Time</li>
<li>Memoji</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>watchOS 5</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Competitions</li>
<li>Automatic Workout Detection</li>
<li>Walkie Talkie</li>
<li>Interactive Notifications</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS Mojave</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dark Mode</li>
<li>Dynamic Desktop</li>
<li>News</li>
<li>Mac App Store</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan on doing some writing about the new features, but in more of an opinionated way, rather than a simple informative guide. You’ll find these with the <a href="https://chrishannah.me/tag/wwdc18/">WWDC 18 tag</a>.</p>
