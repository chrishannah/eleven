title: Introducing the Aqua Screenshot Library
---

<p><a href="https://512pixels.net/2018/08/introducing-the-aqua-screenshot-library/">Stephen Hackett on his latest project</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m really glad to be announcing a project that started at the end of last year. I have worked my way through every major release of macOS since the Mac OS X Public Beta and catalogued them in an extensive collection of screenshots.</p>
<p>Currently, the library includes 1,502 images. That’s 1.6 GB worth of screenshots.</p>

<p>This is something really only he could do. I’ve had a look through some of them, and it’s fun to see how the OS has evolved, and to see the iterations between big changes.</p>
