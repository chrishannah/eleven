title: A Relic of My Musical Past 🎮🎼
---

<p>I was playing around with my latest mini-project, an iMac G3 that I’m trying to get working, and I discovered an old relic. I was trying out various old hard drives of mine, to see which ones I could then use to install System 9.</p>
<p>What surprised me, was a single file in the root of the hard drive, named <code>"blissful glitches.wav"</code>. Oh, and it was created on 1st September 2011.</p>
<p>I was pretty sure when I saw it what it most likely was. Because a very old hobby of mine was making and listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune">Chiptune</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. So I assumed this was maybe a test recording I made. I personally used to use a program called <a href="https://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/index.php">LSDJ</a> on a GameBoy to record my music, but I hardly ever actually finished something. But it turns out this one actually sounds finished.</p>
<p>After I listened to it, I could definitely remember the actual song, but I can’t remember anything about the creation, or when it actually happened. The date on the file is one thing, but it may not be the time I even recorded it from the GameBoy or even the time I started making it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ll cut to the chase.</p>
<p>Listen to <label><a href="https://cl.ly/413u2d3N122Q">blissful glitches.wav</a></label></p>
<p><audio id="t-rex-roar" controls src="https://dzwonsemrish7.cloudfront.net/items/2r0s3G1E2J2R003i0m11/blissful%20glitches.wav">For some reason, the audio file isn&#8217;t supported. ¯&#95;(ツ)&#95;/¯</audio></p>
<p>Maybe this is where you ask for feedback, or “constructive criticism”. But I made this 7 years ago, and even back then, I always created for myself first.</p>
