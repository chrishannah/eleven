title: What I Want in the Next iPhone
---

<p>I started a note a while ago to list out the things I want in the next iPhone, but there‚Äôs honestly not much that I can think of. I may <em>really</em> want these things, but there‚Äôs not many of them.</p>
<p>Just for some perspective, I‚Äôm currently using an iPhone 7 Plus, and I‚Äôm still really happy with the device. But I got it on release day, so after two years I think I‚Äôm due an upgrade. However, taking into consideration the improvements made in the iPhone X, there are just a few things I‚Äôd like the next model (whatever it‚Äôs going to be called) to improve upon.</p>
<p>The first has to be the battery. I don‚Äôt really ever get a full days use out of a single charge, but I do understand that I am a bit of an edge case. I use my phone <em>a lot</em>, whether it‚Äôs at work when I‚Äôm using it as a test device, or when I‚Äôm travelling and I‚Äôm constantly taking photos. I would like the battery life to be great for all types of users, not just when it‚Äôs new, or for someone who uses it less than me.</p>
<p>Following on the photography side of my iPhone use, I wouldn‚Äôt mind the camera getting a bit better. It‚Äôs a pretty good camera, and I get some good shots, but I don‚Äôt think there has been any major leaps in a while. I know this isn‚Äôt a great metric to use as a comparison, but the iPhone 6 had a 12MP camera, and so does the iPhone X. Sure, quite a lot of other things have changed, and the lens makes a lot of difference on it‚Äôs own. But I would like to see an aperture lower than f/1.8, improvements to macro photography, and general improvements to sharpness.</p>
<p>One thing that I expect to see, and I kind of really <em>need</em> in my next device, is the ability to use Face ID in any orientation. I‚Äôm still unsure about facial recognition, seeing as how reliable and fast Touch ID is, and the fact the iPhone X has to be in portrait for it to be unlocked would be pretty annoying. But with the rumours of this coming to the iPad, I don‚Äôt see why the next iPhone wouldn‚Äôt also receive it. Maybe even the iPhone X could retroactively gain support for this as well.</p>
<p>My next wish is something I‚Äôve been wanting for a long time now, and it‚Äôs a reason why I‚Äôve been tempted to buy a Google Pixel before, colourful hardware. In the past, Apple have offered multiple colour options for quite a lot of their products, the early iMacs, iPods, the iPhone 5C, and of course the Apple Watch straps. I really want a phone that isn‚Äôt just a boring slab of monochrome, (I don‚Äôt accept the gold options, and the RED edition takes ages to be launched). Why not something with a bit of character? What about adding a few accents to the side buttons like the Pixel, or going for whole colour changes, like the rumoured orange version (üòç). And I don‚Äôt want any interesting options to be relegated to the cheaper models. I remember when I purchased a 5S, I really wanted the design of the 5C so I could get a bright colour for once, but I wasn‚Äôt going to buy one with old hardware. With a $1 trillion market cap, you‚Äôd think there‚Äôd be room for some more colour options for arguably their main product.</p>
<p>To round up my wishes, there‚Äôs just one more thing (yeah, I wrote that) I want Apple to include. Nothing big or extravagant, just a USB C to Lightning cable in the box as standard. The USB C market clearly isn‚Äôt as big as Apple predicted it would be by now, and I‚Äôve written about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/ideas-and-speculation-on-the-future-of-ipad-connectivity/">how the iPad could improve this</a>, but <em>another</em> push would be if the iPhone connected via USB C.</p>
<p>Anyway, I‚Äôll sit back with everyone else, and await what device we‚Äôre all going to be purchasing.</p>
