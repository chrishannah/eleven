title: An Apple Watch Jailbreak is Probably the Worst Idea Ever

<blockquote>
<p>9to5Mac has a good breakdown of what this jailbreak entails, but I will reiterate that you should not even think about finding this jailbreak. One, I donâ€™t think that watchOS is really in need of a jailbreak community to push it forward right now, but two, this is an incredibly high risk jailbreak! &#8211; BirchTree</p>

<p>I completely agree with all the sentiments here.</p>
