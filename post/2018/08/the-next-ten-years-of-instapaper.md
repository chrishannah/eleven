<p><a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/176732408411">Straight from the Instapaper blog:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To ensure Instapaper can continue for the foreseeable future, it’s essential that the product generates enough revenue to cover its costs. In order to do so, we’re relaunching Instapaper Premium today.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Instapaper Premium is a subscription for $2.99/month or $29.99/year that offers the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-text search for all articles in your account</li>
<li>Unlimited Notes</li>
<li>Text-to-Speech playlists on mobile</li>
<li>Speed reading to get through all of your articles up to 3x faster</li>
<li>An ad-free Instapaper website</li>
<li>“Send to Kindle” using a bookmarklet or our mobile apps</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Instapaper is back!</strong></p>
<p>And that’s not all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are very sorry for the extended downtime and, as a token of our apology, we are giving six months of Instapaper Premium to all EU users affected by the outage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m getting off Pocket this instant, and moving back to Instapaper.</p>
<p>Expect to hear more from me about this.</p>
