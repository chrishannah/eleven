<p>I&#8217;ve literally just finished watching the second film of the Fantastic Beasts series, and I thought I&#8217;d try and get out what I thought of it while it&#8217;s still fresh. Just for additional information, I watched it in IMAX 2D.</p>
<p>It was incredible in so many ways, but maybe the best part was seeing the wizarding world from a whole new perspective. Everyone remembers Newt Scamander from the original Harry Potter series, but he was only an author of a textbook then. And in the first Fantastic Beasts film we did start to get to know him as a person, but you learn quite a bit more in this film.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t fault anything with the film, but I will have to now go and do some research on everything, because I need a few things cleared up!</p>
<p>The revelations in the film will truly shock you. However, I cannot reveal anything. I already can&#8217;t wait for the next instalment.</p>
