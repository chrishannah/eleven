title: Apple Covent Garden Is Reopening!
---

<p>I just received some good news in an email from Apple. They’re finally reopening their Covent Garden store on the 26th October.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come and see our brand-new space. Explore a wide range of inspiring Today at Apple sessions taking place every day. And learn new skills in everything from photography to design, music and more.</p>
<p>Join us to see just how far your creativity can take you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’ve got some interesting events already lined up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photo Walk: Capturing Covent Garden</li>
<li>Performance: Joncan Kavlakoglu</li>
<li>Kids Hour: Draw Along with the Moomins</li>
<li>Business Exclusive: Perfect Your Creative Pitch with Hubbub</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe I’ll have to start looking at going to some of them. I haven’t been to <em>any</em> events at an Apple store yet.</p>
