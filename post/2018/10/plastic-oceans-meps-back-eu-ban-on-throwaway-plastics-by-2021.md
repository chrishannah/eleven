<p>From an <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20181018IPR16524/plastic-oceans-meps-back-eu-ban-on-throwaway-plastics-by-2021">EU Press Release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Single-use plastic items such as plates, cutlery, straws, balloon sticks or cotton buds, will be banned in the EU under plans adopted on Wednesday.</p>
<p>These products, which make up over 70% of marine litter, will be banned from the EU market from 2021, under draft plans approved by Parliament.</p>
<p>MEPs added to this list of plastics banned from the EU market from 2021: products made of oxo-degradable plastics, such as bags or packaging and fast-food containers made of expanded polystyrene.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another step in the right direction.</p>
