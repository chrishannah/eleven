title: Adobe Bringing Full Version of Photoshop CC to iPad in 2019
---

<p>Juli Clover, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/15/adobe-photoshop-cc-ipad-2019/">writing for MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At its annual Adobe Max conference, Adobe announced plans to bring a complete version of Photoshop to the iPad in 2019.</p>
<p>Photoshop CC for iPad will feature a revamped interface designed specifically for a touch experience, but it will bring the power and functionality people are accustomed to on the desktop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m interested to see how Photoshop will actually work on the iPad. They do say it’s the full version, but will it include the automation that was available on the desktop, and how will it fit into the iOS environment? For example, will it have support for Siri Shortcuts, support for a Photo Editing Extension, and how are the toolbars going to be translated into iOS UI?</p>
<p>Then there’s the price. Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo are both priced at £19.99, Pixelmator is only £1.99, and there are apps like Polarr that are free. I’m guessing they’ll extend their Creative Cloud subscription to include the iOS version, but I think a cheaper solution is needed to be competitive on this platform. £9.98 per month is their cheapest individual plan in the UK, and that will deter a lot of people.</p>
<p>Another recent announcement of theirs, <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/introducing-project-gemini/">Project Gemini</a>, is something that’s probably more suited to my uses. As that is a lot simpler, and focuses on drawing and illustrating.</p>
