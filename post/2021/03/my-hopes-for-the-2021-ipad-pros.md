title: My Hopes for the 2021 iPad Pros
---

I've thought about purchasing a 12.9" iPad for a while, but I kept putting it off, until the rumours started last year about new models being introduced in March 2021. After then my mind was made up, I was going to buy get the next _big_ iPad Pro that Apple released.

I wrote in November last year about [what the perfect iPad would be for me](https://chrishannah.me/the-ipad-i-want/), and I concluded that the current Air or Pro models would probably suffice in terms of capability, but since I want the larger screen, I'd need to go for a Pro.

It's a bit of an odd situation, because I know I'm going to buy an iPad at the next event, no matter what gets announced. But I don't have an idea what the next iPad Pro models will be like.

There are rumours of a MiniLED display, which is good I guess, but I wouldn't say that's something I particularly care about. I can't quite recall any other rumours, apart from 5G support, but then again I haven't purposefully looked for any.

Nevertheless, there are a few things that I would like in the next models, and I think a lot of people would also appreciate them:

* Longer battery life (similar to the M1 Macs).
* M1 (or equivalent) chip.
* 2 USB C ports.
* Better front-facing camera, and positioned top-centre while in landscape mode.
* Possibly an even bigger size than 12.9"?

I would also like a new Magic Keyboard to be announced since I think the trackpad could do with being a bit bigger. This is probably unrealistic but could be possible if Apple released a larger size.

Apart from that, the rest of my iPad wishes are software-based. So I'll have to wait until WWDC for those.
