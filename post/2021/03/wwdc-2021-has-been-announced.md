title: WWDC 2021 Has Been Announced
---

Apple has announced the dates for this years WWDC, and as we all expected, its back in it's all-online format that we experienced last year.

Apple Newsroom:

> Apple today announced it will host its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) June 7 through 11, in an all-online format. Free for all developers, WWDC21 will offer unique insight into the future of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Building on the record-breaking participation and learnings from last yearâ€™s online conference, WWDC21 is an opportunity for developers to learn about the new technologies, tools, and frameworks they rely on to build innovative and platform-differentiating apps and games.

I'm very much excited for WWDC this year. A bit more than usual as well. Since I'm on the lookout for a new project to work on, and I'm hoping a new API or technology can unlock something for me.
