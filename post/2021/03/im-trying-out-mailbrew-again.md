title: I’m Trying out Mailbrew Again
---

<p>I’ve been trying to find a way to discover interesting links and generally more things to read. Because, although I currently use a mix of Micro.blog, Twitter, and RSS, to get news/articles delivered to me. It always felt to me that it wasn’t exactly a diverse source of information and that it relied on a number of people discovering something first.</p>

<p>But then I listened to the latest version of AppStories, where <a href="https://appstories.net/episodes/208/">John Voorhees and Federico Viticci discussed how they read newsletters</a>, and they came on to the subject of Mailbrew<sup><a href="#fn1-4193" id="fnr1-4193" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Which reminded me that I tried the service out a while ago, but for some reason that I can’t remember, I stopped using it.</p>

<p>However, they’ve since added a Twitter integration that allows you to view the “top links” from either your timeline or a specific list. And since I’ve stopped using Twitter as much recently, I thought it sounded pretty handy. So I’ve decided to give it a go again.</p>

<p>My daily digest still needs a bit of refinement, since I probably have slightly too many sections. But I’m sure I’ll make changes as I go and if I start seeing trends where a section just isn’t that interesting.</p>

<p>But for now, I’ve gone with these sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>Top posts from Hacker News</li>
<li>Popular items from Product Hunt</li>
<li>Assorted feeds:

<ul>
<li>Designer News</li>
<li>Lifehacker</li>
<li>The Verge</li>
<li>BBC News</li>
<li>The Independent</li>
<li>Dev.to (Swift)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Top posts from specific Reddit subreddits:

<ul>
<li>productivity</li>
<li>design</li>
<li>travel</li>
<li>technology</li>
<li>programming</li>
<li>apple</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Top links from Twitter (I have a few private Twitter lists for bloggers, developers, and tech in general).</li>
</ul>

<p>Mailbrew seems like a really good fit for my desire to have an easy way to get articles from all around the web. I think the only work that I will need to do is to find the sources that are right for me.</p>
