title: No, You Can’t Own Your Computer
---

<p>Amit Gawande, <a href="https://journal.amitgawande.com/no-owning-your-computer">on the idea of completely owning your computer</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><blockquote><p>I want a computer that I own completely. I want a computer that does what I want it to do, not one that has a hidden agenda programmed into it at the factory. And, I want to have these capabilities regardless of what anyone has done to the Internet to prevent me from having them. I don’t want to be dependent on the whims of a government or the good will of a giant corporation.</blockquote></p>
<p>Tie goes on to describe his ideal system and mulls over what he currently has to live with.</p>
<p>This made me think if such a system, or a group of systems for that matter - it’s not just a computer that Tie is talking about here - can actually exist. There’s no incentive for any organization, profit or non-profit, to build such a system. It will not be of interest for an everyday consumer, it would be too dull for him. He would, unmindful of the harms, load it with the unnecessary bloat, ruining the whole promise the system was built on.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of good thoughts in this article. And after some thinking, I’m not sure if this theoretical computer exists.</p>
