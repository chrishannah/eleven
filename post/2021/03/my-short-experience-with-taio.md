title: My (Short) Experience With TAIO
---

<p>Continuing my quest to find the perfect writing app, I turned to <a href="https://taio.app">TAIO</a> (Text all in One). It's been touted as the next best writing app, with it's modern design, and extensive built-in automation support.</p>

<p>I must admit, that clearly I didn't do my research very well. Because as much as I love the level of appearance customisation, and the overall structure to the app, I did not realise that it is not available for Mac.</p>

<p>The developers are working on a macOS version, but don't plan on releasing it anytime soon. That's good news, and means I'll probably look at it again once it's out. Since by then I assume the overall product would have matured even more.</p>

<p>It's unfortunate, since I think TAIO has a lot of potential. But I really want to use one app across all of my devices. So for now I'll be going back to iA Writer. </p>

<p>That will be it for a while I think. I'll spend the next few days putting together some thoughts on what I took from the past few experiments. But I expect that I'll be sticking with iA Writer for a while.</p>
