title: Here's What's new in Ghost 4.0
---

In case you were wondering what was actually new in Ghost 4.0, Matt Birchler made a great video [going over the major changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ql3rHHavig).

Weirdly a lot of this was already "available". Albeit marked as being experimental. For example, I've been using the members feature and email newsletter feature for a few months, and I have an accent colour selected already.

The thing I'd like them to focus on next would be for a better mobile/tablet interface. I don't think we'll ever see a native app from them, seeing as they are a web company. But I'd settle for a website that's at least usable on an iPad.
