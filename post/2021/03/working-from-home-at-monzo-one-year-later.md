title: Working from Home at Monzo üè¶ One Year Later
---

One of my favourite YouTubers, Jake Wright, is a software engineer at Monzo, and he tends to make very interesting videos about how he works. He made a video earlier this year showing how [he'd been working from home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Unj7k9rnU) due to the pandemic.

However,  like most of us software engineers. he's been working from home ever since. And he's created a follow up video going through an entire work day, which I just found it fascinating.
