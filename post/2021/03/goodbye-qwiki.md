title: Goodbye, Qwiki
---

Unfortunately, I've decided to remove Qwiki from sale.

If you weren't aware, Qwiki was a Mac app that placed Wikipedia in your menu bar. It was pretty simple, you could search for a page, view a page, and there were a few methods to export links from the app.

Qwiki was first released in June 2016 and received updates until November 2019. At that point, I was relatively happy with the app, since it was only ever meant to be a minimal way to quickly search Wikipedia.

However, as time has gone on, the codebase has become stale, and the app, in general, doesn't feel at home on the more recent versions of macOS.

I've felt for a while that I shouldn't be offering an app that isn't being maintained, but my thoughts were that while people still used it, there could still be more that could get value from it. But after receiving a few support requests asking for Catalina, mainly around the text appearing too small, small icon resolution, and a few more things, I can't continue to make that excuse anymore. So therefore if I have no plans to ever update the app, I can't ask people to pay money for it.

I toyed with the idea of just making it free, but I still think a free app needs to be of a certain standard, and to a point, maintained.

This means that I now only have one app, [Text Case](http://textcase.app/), although it is available on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. I do have plans to work on a new project this year, but nothing is in the works just yet.
