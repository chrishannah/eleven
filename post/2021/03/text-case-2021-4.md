A small update to Text Case has just been released to both the iOS and macOS versions, and this time it’s just a small collection of fixes.

To be specific:

* There was an issue when using an empty clipboard with certain formats.
* The Add Suffix format wasn’t working correctly.
* In some situations, the Share Extension would regularly close after launch.
* A few Title Case variants were not always capitalising adjectives correctly.

As you can see, not exactly the sort of features one may wish for.

However, now these issues should be resolved, the focus can now switch back to more interesting features. For example, I have a few formats in mind that I want to add next. Some involving regular expressions, which should be fun.

This update is available now for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS!
