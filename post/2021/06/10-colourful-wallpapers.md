title: 10 Colourful Wallpapers
---

As you may have seen on Twitter, over the past few days I’ve been creating various wallpapers. I had a goal of coming up with 10, and I’ve finally hit that goal, so it’s about time I made them available.

I’m making these available as a paid offering (my first on the blog I think) which you can [purchase via Gumroad](https://gum.co/colourful-wallpapers). The price is £3, which equates to roughly just over $4.

Here’s a preview of what each wallpaper looks like:

## CMYK

## Coloured Glass

## Ice Cream

## Pink Hills

## Sunset

## Letters

## Mint Stripes

## Worms

## Triangles

## Pastels

All of these images are squares, and the intention behind that is to allow you to choose your own crop and positioning when setting them as your wallpaper. Each image comes in two sizes - 6,000 x 6,000 pixels, and also 12,000 x 12,000 pixels, because why not.

My intention with these was to create a collection of wallpapers with various styles and colour schemes. So I hope there’s at least a few in there for everybody.
