In addition to the content here on my blog, you can sign up for my **free** monthly newsletter. If you don't want them in your emails, then you can either subscribe to [the site's RSS feed](https://chrishannah.me/feed/), or read the issues directly on the website.

It's just one story a month, no nonsense, just myself going deep into a topic.

Delivered straight to your inbox on the 13th of every month. Because some people find that to be unlucky, and I think that's funny.
