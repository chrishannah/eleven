title: Ghost on the iPad, a Review

<p>Jeff Perry on <a href="https://tablethabit.com/archive/ghost-on-the-ipad-a-review/">the Ghost blogging platform, and his experiences using  it on an iPad</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aside from moving Tablet Habit to a newsletter format, I also moved the entire website from WordPress hosting on EasyWP to Ghost. As an iOS user, I was worried Ghost would be an inferior product on the iPad and iPhone compared to the desktop. I am pleased to say my worry was for nothing.</p><p>

I wanted to share my perspective on using Ghost on the iPad and how I think Ghost can improve this going forward.

I use Ghost to host this blog and my newsletter, so it's good to see someone else enjoying it. Jeff's experience seems to match up with mine, it's a great service, but it can still be improved in a few ways like he mentions.

One of the big reasons why I think I'll stick with Ghost is the member/newsletter support. Without that integration, I could imagine switching back to WordPress in the future. But for now, everything seems pretty good here.
