I don't keep up to date with upcoming series, so this one took me a bit by surpise. Although a very welcome one. At least from the trailer, it looks like it's going to be a pretty good show. This comes at a good time, becasue I was actually thinking of cancelling my Disney+ membership, since I've finished watching The Mandalorian.

I'm sure this series will lead right into the next MCU film, so it will definitely be worth checking this out.
