[Mike Rockwell](https://mike.rockwell.mx/asides/843):


<blockquote>
<p>The problem with insular bubbles isn’t just that you’re surrounded by people that share the same world view. It’s also terribly problematic that every time an opposing viewpoint pokes through, it’s re-told and framed through the lens of someone that already disagrees with it.</p>

<p>You can’t expect to understand the argument unless you actually listen to someone that believes it whole-heartedly.</p>

Absolutely. To understand something, you need to listen to someone who actually has skin in the game.
