title: You Can Now Send From an External Address in Hey
---

[One hell of a feature has been added to Hey](https://hey.com/features/send-as/):


<blockquote>Now you can send email from your @hey.com address plus external email addresses, domains hosted elsewhere, work accounts on other systems, etc.
</blockquote>

While this won’t entice me to make the switch, since I’m pretty happy with my email solution now. But had this option been available before [my experiment](https://chrishannah.me/experimenting-with-email/), I might have given Hey a try.

I still think they should add proper custom domain support. _Then_ I might be tempted to give Hey a try. Mainly because I could then keep my email address the same, and it should be relatively pain free (except the migration of actual emails if needed).
