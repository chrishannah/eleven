I've just been playing [this game](https://virtualvacation.us/guess) for quite a while and it's really fun. The idea is that you get shown a video of a certain area, and you need to guess where it is on a map.

You can choose to play Worldwide, limited to a specific continent, or a few specific countries. I've been playing with Europe, since I've rarely travelled anywhere else. Obviously, I'm pretty good when it comes to the UK, and other popular places throughout the rest of Europe, but I certainly have been surprising myself.
