title: The Dispo Camera App
---

Youtuber David Dobrik has a camera app that I've only just discovered called [Dispo](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1491684197), which is essentially trying to mimic a disposable camera.

The idea is that you use Dispo to take photos, but you then have to wait until your photos are 'developed' to actually see them. Luckily you don't have to wait that long, with the photos being available at 9 am the next day. But there is a kind of lottery when it comes to how your photo will look since it also applies filters to make it seem more like a photo from a disposable camera.

A deeper reason behind the 9 am wait is to combat the kind of instant gratification we've all come to expect when taking photos, and to try and stay in the moment, rather than taking 100 photos and constantly looking over them to see if they're "perfect". To be honest, I understand that angle, but I'm not exactly sure if this app will make much difference in that respect.

There is a 2.0 version that's currently in beta, and while I'm not lucky enough to be testing it, it seems like it will be a pretty major upgrade. It will be interesting to see if they can take this simple camera app to something bigger. Maybe it's going to try and be the Instagram of the past that we all loved?

As for actual photos, I haven't exactly been out much recently, so I haven't been able to take any interesting photos. But here are a few that have already been "developed".
