## üåü Flows

**The major feature of this update is the addition of flows!**

These are customisable combinations of formats, that can be put together to create more complex and personal text transformations.

- Tap on the + in the top-right to create a flow.
- Tap on a flow to have it apply the transformation to your copied text.
- Tap on the pencil to edit a flow.
- Tap on the play button to open a scratchpad with the flow to test the transformation.
- Long-press or right-click on a flow to access all functionality:
	- Format Clipboard
	- Edit Flow
	- Preview Flow
	- Duplicate Flow
	- Delete Flow

## üëÄ New Formats

**There are 8 new formats to use now!**

These formats are more complex than the previous formats, since they all have customisable parameters.

There are:

- Add prefix
- Add suffix
- Replace all occurrences of a given string with another string
- Replace the first occurrence of a given string with another string
- Replace the last occurrence of a given string with another string
- Remove all occurrences of a given string
- Remove the first occurrence of a given string
- Remove the last occurrence of a given string

All of these new formats are available to use within a flow, and also via dedicated actions in the Shortcuts app.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Share Extension Customisation

- It can be configured to show just flows, just formats, or both.
- You can also choose whether you want formats to have their default colour styling.
