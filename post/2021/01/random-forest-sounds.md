title: Listen to Random Forests
---

I wrote a while ago about [ASMR Rooms](https://chrishannah.me/asmr-rooms/) and what I called '[Adaptive Background Environments](https://chrishannah.me/thoughts-on-adaptive-background-environments/)', and I've just come across something similar [via Kottke](https://kottke.org/20/12/listen-to-a-random-forest), called [Tree.fm](https://www.tree.fm).

Tree.fm places you in random forests, immersing you in the sounds, and also providing some nice photography of nature.

I really like listening to nature, forests especially. So I think I'll be using this for some background noise when I'm working, or even when I'm just relaxing. Like now, I'm reading some blogs, and listening to a forest.

All of the sounds are from a project called '[Sounds of the Forest](https://timberfestival.org.uk/soundsoftheforest-soundmap/)', which form an open source library for anyone use. If you go to the website, you get a world map where you can see exactly where each recording came from.

If like me, you are a fan of nature, then I would encourage you to check out [Ecologi](https://ecologi.com). Essentially, it's a subscription service to plant trees and help fund climate projects.

One cool feature of Ecologi is that as you plant more trees, your online forest grows. My forest, [Christopia](https://ecologi.com/christopherhannah) (I couldn't think of a better name) has been going for 4 months,  has 418 trees, and has offset over 9 tonnes of CO2e. __ If you [use this magical link](https://ecologi.com/christopherhannah?r=5f836b8f80bf04001d0b382a), we both get 30 extra trees.
