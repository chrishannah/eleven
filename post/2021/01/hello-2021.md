title: Hello, 2021
---

For many reasons, 2020 wasn’t exactly the best year for a lot of people. A lot of us were aiming for 2020 to be the magical year that we suddenly get a lot of important tasks done, and milestones reached. I suppose that was partly down to the attractiveness of the year 2020.

Nevertheless, 2020 is over, and I think everyone will be welcoming 2021. Hopefully, it can be the year we all thought 2020 would be.

As for myself, I’ve been working on some goals and themes for the year. I haven’t figured it all out yet, but I have a few big ones that I think are pretty definite, so I’m happy to share:

1. Finish and release the major update to Text Case that has been in progress for far too long.
2. Develop and release a new app.
3. Write more regularly, and publish more original writing.

As for the new app, I don’t have any specific requirements for a platform or type of app. I just think it’s good that I work on a new project.

The writing goal as originally planned to be a publishing a blog post every day. But I don’t think this is particularly sustainable, and a general theme may be a better fit for this. Although I still may come up with a loose set of aims to help me keep regular with my writing.

I have other goals, like trying new apps, reading more, etc. But I’ll have to work on them some more. For now, I think the most important one will be to build up a habit of writing every day, with the hope it leads to regular publishing.
