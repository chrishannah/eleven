title: The Feeling of Material You
---

David Imel has made a [fantastic video on Google's Material You design language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7pks7yqQOc) and how it aims to focus on _feel_ rather than just function. And how its imperfection, constructed from customisability, and personal touches are what makes it good.

Ever since Material You was announced, I've been a fan. I'm not sure if I could pick a winner between Material You and the design language Apple have used in iOS and iPadOS because I think they are born from different perspectives, and both have their own pros and cons.

The best way I can articulate the design differences, is that Apple's design feels clean and precise, while Material You looks much more personal. Both are valid choices, but they're still different, and I think that's great. Because more choice can only be a good thing.
