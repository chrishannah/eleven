title: “Built using Bulba”
---

Two announcements. Firstly, I’m building a static site generator. And secondly, that I’m using said generator to power a new blog of mine.

## Bulba

That’s the name. My new side-project, which is a static site generator, built using Node.js, that can transform a few Markdown files into a static site. It’s still early days now, but it’s already got paginated index pages, archive, about page, JSON feed, and of course, a page for every blog post.

I’m in no way a Node.js or JavaScript programmer, so I can’t always be certain that my code is the best. (Nor can I say that it’s the worst). But I think it will be a fun project to work on, and maybe in the future other people can use it.

You can find Bulba on [GitHub](http://github.com/chrishannah/Bulba) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chrishannah/bulba).

## Development Blog

To both demonstrate the features of my new tool, and to also share the progress of it’s development, I’m using Bulba to power a new development blog. It’s got a pretty nice url as well: [dev.chrishannah.me](https://dev.chrishannah.me) .

Right now, I’m using it for Bulba specific updates, but I can imagine that in the future I may use it to write about other projects I work on too.

Earlier today, I published a post, “[Introduction to Bulba](https://dev.chrishannah.me/introduction-to-bulba.html)”, on my new blog, where I introduce Bulba in detail, showing how it works, what features are currently implemented, and also what I’m working on next.
