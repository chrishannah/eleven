I have far too many Zoom calls at work, and I always hate the process of finding the calendar event, and then copying the Zoom code or link. Especially as it's never always in the correct place.

So I was seaching for an app that could make this experience better, and I found [MeetingBar](https://github.com/leits/MeetingBar). It's a menu bar app that shows a list of the days meetings, and you can just click on one of them to join the associated video call.

It's massively customisable, and supports Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, and a few more. One thing I plan on looking at deeper is the custom regex for meeting links, as there are a few odd meetings in my calendar with rather oddly formatted meeting codes.
