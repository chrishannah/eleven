title: The Rabbit R1
---

I finally watched the [Rabbit R1 announcement video][a] earlier, and while
I think it's a really raw product and has a lot to prove, I was definitely
wowed by it. Maybe it's the hardware design (which was done in partnership with
[Teenage Engineering][t]), or the idea that this will actually be able to *do*
things for you, rather than just be another conversational AI. Either way,
shortly after watching the video, I decided to pre-order an R1.

The relatively low entry price for the R1 at $199/Â£160 definitely helped. But I
also wanted to put my money where my mouth was. Since products like the Rabbit
R1 and others like the [Human Ai Pin][h] are examples of the direction that I want
technology to move towards.

In my ideal world, technology would be used to help us understand, explore, and
experience the world around us. Rather than keep us locked away in digital
worlds, cut off from people around us. No matter how "connected" it can make us
feel when we've got a screen constantly in front of our face.

I'm hopeful that we're moving in the right direction.
