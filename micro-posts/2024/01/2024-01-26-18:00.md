[The Verge][v]:
> Microsoft is laying off 1,900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox this week.

Just as World of Warcraft (and Blizzard) starting looking like it was on the up.

I'm hoping this won't affect their existing games, such as WoW. But since Mike
Ybarra (Blizzard President) is leaving, and the [survival game][s] that was in
development has been cancelled, it's not looking great.
