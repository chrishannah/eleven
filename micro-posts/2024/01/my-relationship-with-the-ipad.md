title: My Relationship With the iPad
---

I have a weird relationship with my iPad. I can go months without using it all,
and then suddenly something switches in me, and I want to use it for everything.

While I'm not trying to blame anyone, I think a lot of this comes from me
falling for the "what is a real computer" or the "everyone can work from an
iPad" hype that used to be quite common on the internet.

Now I'm not saying either those are objectively true or false, or that I want to try and change anyone else's opinions on the iPad. But whenever I pick up my iPad Pro, without any case or keyboard attached, it feels magical to me. It feels like I'm using a computer from a science fiction show[^1]. 

It's because of that feeling, coupled with the conversations around it having the ability to be your *only* computer, I start wanting to do more things with it. I attach the Magic Keyboard because then it looks like a laptop, and that's a *real* computer, so it must mean it becomes better. I also then occasionally connect a mouse, or even play around with the Apple Pencil, because this clearly makes it a more capable computer.

Yet every time, it leads me to getting irritated with the quirks/drawbacks of
the iPad and then avoiding it for another month (or few). Instead of just
letting the iPad be the magical device that it can be *for me*.

I need to learn how to just enjoy things for what they are, and not try to dream
up weird and wonderful scenarios that add needless complexities and friction in
my life.

[^1]: Don't take this as me thinking the iPad is a perfect computer. But that's
    not important right now.
