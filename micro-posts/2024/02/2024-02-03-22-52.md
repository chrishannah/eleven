I've been following the progress of the upcoming version of System76's [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) ever since I heard about their idea to write their own desktop environment in Rust. It's going to be a pretty huge update by the looks of it, and it goes by [Cosmic](https://blog.system76.com/post/cosmic-the-road-to-alpha).

From what I've read on the blog, and also watched via the episode of [Tech Over Tea](https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=fEdy5rChFNg\&t\=3074s) with YouTuber (Host) Brodie Robertson and System76 founder Carl Richell, I'm 100% going to try it out when it's' available. And I really think there's a chance that if I like it, I could eventually persuade myself into buying a System76 computer in the future.
