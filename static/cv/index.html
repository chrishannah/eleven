				<h2>Profile</h2>

				<p>I am an enthusiastic, ambitious and hard-working individual with excellent problem-solving skills. I
					pride myself on my speed of adapting to new technologies and learning new skills. Furthermore, I
					have a passion for technology which fuels my aspiration to keep learning and always take on new
					things as I like a challenge. </p>

				<p>I have been developing software for most of my life, including websites, mobile and desktop
					applications, REST APIs, and various others. However, my focus over the past 7 years has been
					predominantly application develop for Apple platforms. Although professionally, I have also been
					spending some more time with Java over the last few years for server-side projects, among other
					things.</p>

				<p>Iâ€™m very much a product-minded developer, so I pay attention to the design and usability to the
					features that Iâ€™m implementing. I try to work as closely to Product and Design as possible.</p>

				<h2>Work Experience</h2>

						<h3>WorldFirst UK (Ant Group)</h3>
					</summary>

					<p><strong>Senior Software Engineer / Enterprise Solutions Architect</strong><br /><em>August 2022 â€“
							Present</em></p>

					<p>My role has two parts. Firstly, as a Solutions Architect for our Enterprise API product, both
						onboarding partners, and developing it.</p>

					Secondly, I work on various core components of the WorldFirst ecosystem, which are mainly Java
					applications that communicate via RPC interfaces. These applications are predominantly multi-tenant,
					at a very large scale, and also involving critical tasks such as moving mass numbers of funds, or
					synchronising big amounts of data between platforms.</p>

					<p>A few examples of technologies that I have used in this role:
					<ul>
						<li>Distributed and sharded OceanBase databases.
						<li>Message distribution using kafka-like tool SofaMQ. (Ant Group)</li>
						<li>Bulk data syncrhonisation, combining a message queue with data batching, and cross-region
							networking.</li>
						<li>Designing and documenting software architecture solutions.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<p>I have also undertook a few extra projects, such as building a NetSuite integration to help
						customers view their transaction data inside NetSuite.</p>
					<p><strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong><br /><em>August 2020 â€“ August 2022</em></p>

					<p>My role as iOS Developer was expanded to not only focus on improving and maintaining the two
						iOS
						apps, but to also be work on the services that the apps depended on. </p>

					<p>This involved spending my time with many Java projects, where I built REST APIs using Spring
						Boot
						and
						other internal frameworks, and helped build the APIs necessary to comply with the Open
						Banking/PSD2
						regulations. </p>

					<p>Among other smaller projects, I also helped build an SSO solution using Keycloak, configured
						CI/CD
						for various Java applications using Bamboo and Jenkins, and was writing documentation for
						our
						public-facing APIs.</p>

					<p><strong>iOS Developer</strong><br /><em>May 2017 â€“ August 2020</em></p>

					<p>My work in this role was mainly two big projects, to rewrite the two iOS apps, Money Transfer
						and
						World Account in the Swift language, while improving the overall code quality and structure.
						I
						completed this task on my own, and then continued to maintain and update the app as the sole
						iOS
						developer on the team. </p>

					<p>During this role, I also set up the initial CI/CD infrastructure for iOS apps, which involved
						Fastlane scripts to both run the tests and deploy test builds ready for QA engineers.</p>

				<p>Hi, I'm <span class="p-name">Chris</span>. ðŸ‘‹</p>
				<p>I'm currently open for a new role as a Senior Software Engineer.</p>
				<p>I have over 6 years of profressional experience, and my roles have ranged from building entire iOS
					applications for customers to manage and perform international payments, to huge scale Java backend
					applications that deal with moving large amounts of funds.</p>
				<p>With my range of experience, I would be open to a specific role in either iOS Development or Java
					backend applications, but I would also be capable in a more combined, full-stack role.</p>
				<p>I am also open to learning other technologies should they be required or desired. This is both a
					skill of mine, and also something I enjoy.</p>
