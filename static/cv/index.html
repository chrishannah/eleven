				<h2>Profile</h2>

				<p>I am an enthusiastic, ambitious and hard-working individual with excellent problem-solving skills. I
					pride myself on my speed of adapting to new technologies and learning new skills. Furthermore, I
					have a passion for technology which fuels my aspiration to keep learning and always take on new
					things as I like a challenge. </p>

				<p>I have been developing software for most of my life, including websites, mobile and desktop
					applications, REST APIs, and various others. However, my focus over the past 7 years has been
					predominantly application develop for Apple platforms. Although professionally, I have also been
					spending some more time with Java over the last few years for server-side projects, among other
					things.</p>

				<p>I’m very much a product-minded developer, so I pay attention to the design and usability to the
					features that I’m implementing. I try to work as closely to Product and Design as possible.</p>

					</summary>

					<p>
						<strong>Senior Software Engineer / Enterprise Solutions Architect</strong><br/>
						<em>August 2022 –
							Present</em>
					</p>

					<p>My role has two parts. Firstly, as a Solutions Architect for our Enterprise API product. Which involves understanding the specific requirements, designing the solution using our existing API, and then leading the integration and testing phases through various environments.</p>
					<p>Secondly, I work on various core components of the WorldFirst ecosystem, which are mainly Java applications that communicate via RPC interfaces. These applications are predominantly multi-tenant, at a very large scale, and also involving critical tasks such as moving mass numbers of funds, or synchronising big amounts of data between platforms.</p>
					<p>I was part of a small team that undertook a project to architect and develop a solution to migrate our business data to Salesforce. This was built to synchronise tens of millions of data points a day without requiring to expand our current infrastructure. This was in part to replace an existing solution that I maintain and improve, to syncrhonise data using Python scripts with the Apache Airflow system to synchronise data between various platforms.</p>
					<p>A core part of my work as a software engineer is building core functionality in various Java-based backened services that use a proprietary RPC system to communicate between applications. However, I have also worked a lot on the public-facing REST APIs for various Open Banking related APIs, including Confirmation of Payee, and the general Read/Write APIs.</p>
					<p>I have also undertook a few extra projects, such as building a NetSuite integration to help customers view their transaction data inside NetSuite, which was built using JavaScript and NetSuite&#39;s SuiteScript framework.</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong><br/>
						<em>August 2020 – August 2022</em>
					</p>

					<p>After moving into a senior role, my responsibilities continued to expand. Which meant while I was still spending some time maintaining the iOS apps, my primary focus switched to backend applications.</p>
					<p>This initially involved spending my time with many Java projects, where I built REST APIs using Spring Boot and other internal frameworks, and helped build the APIs necessary to comply with the Open Banking/PSD2 regulations. This project also included building an SSO solution using Keycloak, CI/CD pipelines using Bamboo and Jenkins, and public-facing documentation.</p>
					<p>Afterwards, I was moved onto more core applications, which were all Java-based, and built using a proprietary framework built on SpringBoot. The projects I was a core part of during this period was a public-facing REST API for our enterprise partners, which offered full payment/fx functionality, a queue-based ledger and funds migration system to migrate to a new payment platform, and also various functions for an internal back office system.</p>

					<p>
						<strong>iOS Developer</strong><br/>
						<em>May 2017 – August 2020</em>
					</p>

					<p>My work in this role was mainly two big projects, to rewrite the two iOS apps, Money Transfer and World Account in the Swift language, while improving the overall code quality and structure. I completed this task on my own, and then continued to maintain and update the app as the sole iOS developer on the team. </p>
					<p>During this role, I also set up the initial CI/CD infrastructure for iOS apps, which involved Fastlane scripts to both run the tests and deploy test builds ready for QA engineers.</p>
					<p>I also spent some time in the latter stages of this role, working on some backend applications that were built with Java, which provided the functionality for the mobile applications, and also other parts of the platform.</p>

			<p>Hi, I'm <span class="p-name">Chris</span>. 👋</p>
			<p>I'm currently open for a new role as a Senior Software Engineer.</p>
			<p>I have over 6 years of profressional experience, and my roles have ranged from building entire iOS
					applications for customers to manage and perform international payments, to huge scale Java backend
					applications that deal with moving large amounts of funds.</p>
			<p>With my range of experience, I would be open to a specific role in either iOS Development or Java
					backend applications, but I would also be capable in a more combined, full-stack role.</p>
			<p>I am also open to learning other technologies should they be required or desired. This is both a
					skill of mine, and also something I enjoy.</p>
