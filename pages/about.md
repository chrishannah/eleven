## I build things.

<p class="home-bio">
    I work as a Senior Software Engineer at <a id="wf-link" href="https://www.worldfirst.com">WorldFirst</a> where I work on all types of software, using Java, Python, JavaScript, and anything else I can get my hands on.
    </p>

<p class="home-bio">
    I also spend a lot of my personal time writing code. I've got a bunch of open-source stuff on <a id="gh-link" href="https://github.com/chrishannah/">GitHub</a>, and also a few apps: <a id="tc-link" href="https://textcase.app/">Text Case</a>, and <a id="ts-link" href="https://chrishannah.me/text-shot/">Text Shot</a>.
    </p>

<p class="home-bio">
        Aside from writing code, I enjoy photography and writing.
        </p>

<p class="home-bio">
        For photography, I'm really getting into 35mm film cameras and seeing what I can achieve with older cameras. I post some photograpy <a id="b-link" href="https://chrishannah.me/photography">here</a>, but a lot more to  <a id="ig-link" href="https://instagram.com/lordchrishannah">Instagram</a>.
        </p>
<p class="home-bio">And for writing, I have a tendency to write about almost anything, in concentrated bursts. I'm currently trying to refine my writing into a more focussed approach where I write thought out <a id="b-link" href="https://chrishannah.me/essays">essays</a>, rather than short-lived thoughts. But you can find a full archive <a id="b-link" href="https://chrishannah.me/archive">here</a>.
