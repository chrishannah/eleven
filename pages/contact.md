If you want to get hold of me, there are a few different ways to do so.

I'd say the most likely way to get a response is via 𝕏 or Mastodon. If you have something longer to tell/ask me, then email is probabluy the better choise. However, I'm not that good at keeping up with my emails, so don't expect a quick reply!
