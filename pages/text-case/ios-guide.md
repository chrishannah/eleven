Welcome to Text Case! This guide will help you get the most out of your text transformation app.

---

## Getting Started

Text Case transforms your text into over 70 different formats. Simply type or paste text into the scratchpad, and instantly see it converted across all available formats.

### The Main Tabs

- **Scratchpad** - Your main workspace for transforming text
- **Flows** - Custom transformation pipelines
- **Formats** - Browse all available formats
- **Settings** - Customize your experience

---

## Scratchpad

The scratchpad is where you'll spend most of your time. It shows your input text and all available transformations at once.

### Basic Usage

1. Tap the input field at the top
2. Type or paste your text
3. Scroll through the results to find your desired format
4. Tap any format to copy the converted text

### Display Options

- **List View** - Compact format showing one conversion per row
- **Grid View** - Visual cards showing each format (iPad/Mac)
- Toggle between views using the button in the navigation bar

### Filtering Formats

Not all formats are useful for everyone. You can hide formats you don't need:

1. Tap the filter icon in the navigation bar
2. Uncheck formats you want to hide
3. Your preferences sync across all your devices via iCloud

### Favorites

Mark frequently used formats as favorites:

1. Long-press on any format
2. Tap "Add to Favorites"
3. Use the filter to show only favorites

## Flows

Flows let you chain multiple transformations together. For example, you could create a flow that converts text to uppercase and then adds a prefix.

### Creating a Flow

1. Go to the Flows tab
2. Tap the + button
3. Give your flow a name
4. Add formats in the order you want them applied
5. Choose a color for easy identification
6. Save your flow

### Using a Flow

- Tap a flow to apply it to your clipboard
- Tap the play button to preview how it transforms text
- Tap the pencil icon to edit the flow

### Flow Actions (Long-press)

- **Format Clipboard** - Apply the flow to copied text
- **Edit Flow** - Modify the flow
- **Preview Flow** - Test the transformation
- **Duplicate Flow** - Create a copy
- **Delete Flow** - Remove the flow

## Share Extension

Use Text Case directly from other apps:

1. Select text in any app
2. Tap Share
3. Choose Text Case from the share sheet
4. Select a format or flow
5. The converted text is copied to your clipboard

### Customizing the Share Extension

In Settings > Share Extension, you can:

- Show only formats, only flows, or both
- Enable colored format backgrounds

---

## Siri Shortcuts

Add voice commands for your favorite formats:

1. Go to Settings > Add to Siri
2. Choose a format
3. Record a custom phrase
4. Say the phrase to Siri to transform your clipboard

## Statistics & Usage Tracking

Keep an eye on how you or your team are using Text Case by visiting **Settings > Statistics**:

- **Sources**: Usage is counted from the scratchpad, Format Detail copy button, Share Extension, Flows, Widgets, Keyboard, Shortcuts/Siri, and macOS Services. Copying a conversion registers immediately.
- **Flows**: When you run a flow, every format in the pipeline is logged individually so the Top Formats view reflects the actual transformations performed.
- **Top Formats Toggle**: Tap **Show All** to expand beyond the top 10 entries or collapse back to the default view.
- **Weekly Summary**: The "Total (7 days)" row now includes the best day inline ("Best: X") so you can see streaks at a glance.
