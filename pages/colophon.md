This website is built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), and hosted via [Vercel](https://vercel.com). It automatically deploys whenever I push changes to the [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrishannah/eleven). (Have a look if you're interested)

When it comes to writing new content, changing the design, or adding new features, that is mostly done in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) Although, I do occasionally open up [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The only automation I have set up in terms of writing content, is that I have a few scripts that create a draft post file that has some basic frontmatter. So I can pretty much just start writing straightaway.

I literally just edit text files, and then commit/push then to the repo and my site is built in around 10-20 seconds.
