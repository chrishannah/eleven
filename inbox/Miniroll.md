# Miniroll

This year is already off to a productive start, as I've launched my first new project!

It's called [Miniroll](https://miniroll.app), and it's a way to create, share, and embed blogrolls. Along with many other things.

It's not just about your blogrolls either, as you can choose to make them public. Which means other people can too! So you can find other peoples blogrolls and find new blogs in the Explore section.

There's a whole bunch of features that Miniroll already supports, which is wild as it's only just "launched" today. But as of right now, every user can:

- Create and manage a blogroll.
- Make the blogroll public, and let others know what you're reading.
- Import and export OPML files to make everything easier.
- Use CMD+K to open the command palette, or use keyboard shortcuts directly for most actions.
- Embed your blogroll on your own site!

And if you're generous enough to sign up for the premium tier ($2 monthly, $20 yearly), you can:

- Have as many blogrolls as you want.
- Use a custom URL for your public blogroll.
- Allow people to suggest new blogs via the blogroll or an embed.
- Customise your embed with custom CSS, removing the Miniroll link, show the title, or add custom footer text.
- Get a single RSS feed for your blogroll. Which is dynamic as your blogroll changes.
- Get some basic analytics on the number of views and clicks your blogroll has attracted.

There's all of that, and a bunch more on the way soon!
