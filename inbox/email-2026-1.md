# I need to get better at email

This is probably my first goal for 2026.

My email is a mess.

I've got a few different addresses, which were meant to be for different purposes. But slowly they’ve sort of merged together into a big pile of advertising, newsletters I don't read, updates from shops I bought one thing from 10 years ago, etc.

It’s hard to cut through the noise and read email that actually matters.

As for spam, the worst culprit has to be iCloud. Any spam filtering may as well not exist. I can move an email to junk, and try to use the built-in unsubscribe tool. But nevertheless, the next day the exact same email will arrive.

Gmail isn’t *as bad*, but since some of the addresses are technically publicly available, they're no doubt picked up by bots.

Then, there's always the chance of a leak, or a company selling my data.

What I really want is a way to separate email from people, emails not from people but important, and the rest.

I have a "reply via email" button here on my blog, but the emails get thrown onto the pile. So I probably end up missing some emails from people, where I would have probably liked to reply and to have a conversation.

I'm not sure I'm ready to create any new email addresses. I've done that before, and I still end up in the same place. But when I get some free time, I definitely want to look into this more.

There has to be a tool that makes email usable.
