<p>Every single I see this advert, I'm amazed at how brilliant just a single bit of conversation is. It's probably my favourite bit of marketing ever.</p>
<blockquote>
  Person 1: *spots Head and Shoulders*
  <br />
  <br />
  Person 1: "I didn't know you had dandruff?"
  <br />
  <br />
  Person 2: "I don't."
  <br />
</blockquote>
<p>
  Is it weird that I find that absolutely brilliant? If you have dandruff (luckily I don't), then what better way could you have a product marketed to you?
