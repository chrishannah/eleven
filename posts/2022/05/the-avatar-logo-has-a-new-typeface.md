title: The Avatar Logo Has a New Typeface
---

As you probably already know, [Avatar: The Way of Water](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1630029/) will come out at the end of this year. However, the logo won’t be in the same Papyrus typeface as the original. Instead, John Roshell at Swell Type was commissioned to create a new typeface for the upcoming film.

They have [written about the process](https://swelltype.com/yep-i-created-the-new-avatar-font/) on the Swell Type blog, which is a relatively short, but fascinating read nonetheless. I was initially surprised that a new typeface was created, instead of the logo being designed. But when you think about how many places this typeface will be used—the film, websites, marketing, social media, etc. it makes sense.

Talking about the new typeface itself, I think it suits Avatar very well. It has a clear evolution from Papyrus, but adds a bit more character.

I’m now going to be hyper-aware of this typeface whenever I see anything relating to Avatar, but I wonder if _normal_ people will notice anything different?
