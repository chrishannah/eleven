title: Spotify x Heardle
---

Spotify aquired Heardle recently, and when [I commented on the news](https://chrishannah.me/spotify-buys-heardle/), I was relatively positive in that it seemed like a deal that made sense, at least for Spotify.

However, I must say, since the aquisition, the music choices has been terrible. I know there's going to be days when I can't work out the song, but it's just been absolute nonsense. It's certainly made it a lot less fun.
