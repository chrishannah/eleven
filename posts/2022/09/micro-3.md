title: Cutting Down on Subscriptions
---

In a recent post, [Lee Peterson talked about cutting down on subscriptions](https://ljpuk.net/2022/09/23/letting-my-glass-and-tweetbot-subscriptions-expire/), focussing on both Tweetbot and Glass.

I subscribe to both of these, and to be honest, I've jumped in and out of Glass a few times already. I'm not quite sure how much Glass has _to me_, but at the same time I appreciate the platform itself, so it can always find a way to attract me back.

But as he mentions in his post, Tweetbot hasn't been updated in over 6 months. I just checked my subscriptions, and it appears that mine is a year long subscription that has recently been renewed. So I guess I'll just have to deal with it. But I can imagine, that if you started paying a monthly sub for Tweetbot just 6 months ago, with the concept of this supporting developers to release regular updates, you'd be a bit miffed.
