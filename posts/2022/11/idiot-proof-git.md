title: Idiot Proof Git
---

[Doug Turnbull](https://softwaredoug.com/blog/2022/11/09/idiot-proof-git-aliases.html):

> I’m an idiot. And git is hard. A lot of places use a rebase-based Git workflow, and I’ve made git less hard with a set of handy aliases. Put these in your ~/.gitconfig and turn git into an actually less painful command line tool to use.

For people that want to use Git, but either aren't a developer, or just want an easier way to use common functionality via the command line, these may be for you.

There's aliases to update your local code, publish your code, sync your code with the master branch, and a few other helpful commands like opening a PR on GitHub.
