> Ever get to the point that you have too many apps that you’re either not sure about or serve the same purpose. I’ve hit that point again with productivity apps, so I’ve deleted them all and I’m taking a step back.

I think I'm going to have to do something similar myself soon. I wrote recently about [the way I use my phone](https://chrishannah.me/the-way-i-use-technology-is-changing/), and how I have over a hundred apps but rarely use most of them. It would be interesting to see what a more refined phone setup would look like.
