title: Good Days
---

Random thought: Whenever I think about the best days of my life so far, or just days where I thought it was "pretty good", they very rarely involve technology.

As someone that has been interested in technology to a certain degree for most of my life. It's weird to think that most of the time, I prefer life without it. A day where I don't use my phone at all is usually a pretty good day.
