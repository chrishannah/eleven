title: Improving Your Life Without Really Trying
---

The Guardian have published a great article listing [100 different ways that you can improve your life without really trying](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/marginal-gains-100-ways-to-improve-your-life-without-really-trying). It’s both insightful and funny, so I’d recommend giving it a once-over.

My favourites would have to be these:

* Keep a bird feeder by a window, ideally the kitchen. It’ll pass the time when you’re washing up.
* Sharpen your knives.
* Laugh shamelessly at your own jokes.
* Eat salted butter (life’s too short for unsalted).
* Don’t save things for “best”. Wear them – enjoy them.
* Always be willing to miss the next train.
* Listen to the albums you loved as a teenager.
