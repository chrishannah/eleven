title: Blizzard Are Working on a New Survival Game
---

In some very much unexpected news, Blizzard have announced that they’re developing a new survival game, for both PC and console (which, I assume, will now be Xbox).

[Blizzard](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23768911/create-a-new-universe-with-us):

> Blizzard is embarking on our next quest. We are going on a journey to a whole new universe, home to a brand-new survival game for PC and console. A place full of heroes we have yet to meet, stories yet to be told, and adventures yet to be lived. A vast realm of possibility, waiting to be explored.Every story needs a teller. And every world needs builders. What if that could be you?For thirty years, Blizzard has been creating universes for millions of players around the globe. This requires a diverse team of developers willing to lend their voices, to listen and to be heard. That is our mission.

As much as World of Warcraft has had more downsides than good for the past few years, and so has the company (and parent company) as a whole. I used to regard Blizzard as being my favourite game developers. They always seemed to be the ones that would arrive late, with a few delays, but always ended up making a great game.

I’ve been a theoretical fan of survival games since Day-Z came out, and I’ve tried a few of them, but they’ve all felt a bit boring to me. I’ve never found one with any real depth. Maybe that’s because I haven’t tried the right one, but I would assume that a Blizzard one would probably be my best bet, as I’ve enjoyed all of their games so far.

The artwork definitely looks interesting, and looks like it matches the style of World of Warcraft and Hearthstone, which I very much like.

I like the idea of this survival game being set in the Warcraft universe, but I can also accept that it might be time for some new worlds and characters. I guess I would be fine with it either way.

One thought in my mind is that I hope this doesn’t take away anything from World of Warcraft. There’s been a few recent leaks regarding a potential ‘Dragon Isles’ expansion for WoW, and they all sound good to me. So if they are true, and WoW does seem to be on the right path again, I hope it can continue that way.
