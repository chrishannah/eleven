title: From a Blog Post to a Printed Essay
---

I’ve been thinking about my writing recently, but from a different perspective to normal. This time thinking about the longer-term _life_ of some of the things I’ve written. Not the quick link posts, or the product reviews, or anything like that, but more of the longer-form pieces that I’ve really put thought into.

I’m not sure how to best explain them, but if I could choose a few examples that fit into this category, which I’ll be calling “essays”, they would be these:

* [Weeds are Subjective](https://chrishannah.me/weeds-are-subjective/)
* [So-Called Imperfections](https://chrishannah.me/so-called-imperfections/)
* [Tricking Yourself Into Being Productive](https://chrishannah.me/tricking-yourself-into-being-productive/)
* [Focussing on the Wrong Things When Starting a Blog](https://chrishannah.me/focussing-on-the-wrong-things-when-starting-a-blog/)

These all range roughly from the 500 to 1300 word mark. So, it’s not always a certain length. But I would say that what I call an essay, is a piece of writing that you could print out and have it stand on its own, without needing to be supported by the context of my blog.

I’ve gone through my blog and found 25 posts that I feel fit this category, and organised them with the “Essay” tag, which is [available to read individually](https://chrishannah.me/tag/essay/), and has been added to the main navigation bar at the top.

I’m mainly thinking for archival purposes, but the thought of having my writing in book form, especially a physical copy, sounds very appealing.

Maybe those books could be available for others, although I would guess that they would only ever be available digitally. But it’s certainly something I want to look into soon.

The concept that I think would suit my writing best would be a collection of volumes, where perhaps Volume I has X pieces of writing, and then Volume II has the next X pieces of writing, and so on.

I think that’s my first project for 2022. Curating my best writing so far, and making a book. First for myself, but also potentially for others.
