title: Most Primitive Building Videos Aren't Real
---

If you've ever fallen into the YouTube rabbit hole deep enough to find the types of building videos, where there are a few people in a remote place, seemingly building relatively elaborate structures with mud and water, you may (or may not) be surprised to find out that they are mostly fake.

The YouTube channel SunnyV2 made a great video showing how they are staged, and how much work really goes into a lot of the builds.
