title: A Giant Archive Inside a Working Salt Mine
---

Sounds pretty weird, I'm sure. But [thanks to Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce-QHeZnVu4), you can get a glimpse of a working salt mine in the north of England that also doubles as a physical archive. And it's _huge_.

I must admit, I'm relatively new to his videos. But I've been binging them a lot recently, and they're absolutely fascinating.
