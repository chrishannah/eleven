title: The Early Internet is Breaking
---

I just watched this great video on the early web - [The early internet is breaking - here’s how the World Wide Web from the 90s on will be saved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LzyRcLJdlg). It's relatively short, but it shows what the web looked like in the 1990s, and how prevalent personal website were. And also the measures that some people are taking to try to preserve early and current websites.

I wish personal websites were still as popular nowadays, the web sure was a fun place to be when they were.
