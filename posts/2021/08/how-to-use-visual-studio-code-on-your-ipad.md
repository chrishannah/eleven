title: How to use Visual Studio Code on your iPad
---

Thord D. Hedengren, shared [a great tip on his Switch to iPad blog on using VS Code on an iPad](https://switchtoipad.com/features/how-to-use-visual-studio-code-on-your-ipad/):

> One of the most popular code editors for web developers today, is Visual Studio Code, or VS Code for short. It’s made by Microsoft and is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. Unfortunately, there isn’t an official iPad app just yet, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use VS Code on your iPad. At least not if you use GitHub to manage your codebase.

How you access it is pretty inventive:

> Now, assuming you’ve got a GitHub account, and a repository, you’ll also need a keyboard. Any bluetooth keyboard will do, just as the Magic Keyboard if you’re on an iPad Pro.Navigate to your repository in your web browser (you might want to use Safari to be safe), then press the period (.) key. Yep, that’s it, now VS Code will load up your repository, in your web browser window, just like that.

VS Code is an app I use a lot at my day job, for all use cases where I’m not using Xcode to write Swift, or IntelliJ to write Java. I also use it when modifying my blog theme, and playing around with random text files.

I’d love it if the app could come to the iPad as an app. It’s built on web technologies so it wouldn’t be _fully_ native, but as much as I’d love to use the web version of VS Code, I don’t want to be reliant on an internet connection to edit a local file.
