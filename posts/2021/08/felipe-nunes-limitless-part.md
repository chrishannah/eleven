title: Felipe Nunes’ ”Limitless” Part
---

Felipe Nunes is a professional skateboarder, and a great one at that. But he has a disability that you'd expect to severely hamper his ability to ride a skateboard, let alone be right up there with the best in the sport. At the age of six, Felipe had an accident that caused him to lose the lower half of both his legs. But that absolutely didn't stop him.

Even if you're not that interested in skateboarding, I'd still urge you to watch [his latest video](https://youtu.be/wRXktD5GOSo), and if you want to learn more about him, then his [interview with Thrasher Magazine](https://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/felipe-nunes-interview/) is a good place to start.
