The last few updates to [Text Case](https://textcase.app) have mainly been bug fixes and refinements, but in this update, there are 15 new formats!

These formats fall into three categories - Hashing, JSON, and Counts.

**Hashing**

* MD2
* MD4
* MD5
* SHA1
* SHA224
* SHA256
* SHA384
* SHA512

**JSON**

* Format JSON
* Minify JSON

**Counts**

* Count Characters
* Count Characters (Excluding Whitespace)
* Count Words
* Count Lines
* Count Lines (Excluding Blank Lines)

The formats list has also ben organised into groups, so finding the right format should also be easier.

Just to confirm, these new formats, along with every other format in Text Case are accessible from inside the app, the Shortcuts app, via the Share Extension, and also via Services on the Mac.
