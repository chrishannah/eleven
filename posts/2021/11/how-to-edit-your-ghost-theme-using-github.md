title: How To Edit Your Ghost Theme Using Github
---

Who knew that you integrate a GitHub repository to your Ghost blog and have your theme automatically deploy? I for sure didn't, but luckily Greg Morris did, and [he's written a great guide on how to set it all up](https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-to-edit-your-ghost-theme-using-github/):

> Since [first trying Ghost](https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/migrating-from-wordpress/), one of the best things about editing my theme is the ability to host on Github. Through a simple integration I can easily edit my theme to make changes from almost anywhere. If you want to do this too, this guide should help you out.

I've just run through this guide myself, and the theme for this blog now automatically updates whenever I push changes to my repository. This is going to be so much better than using scp or sftp to manually upload changes.
