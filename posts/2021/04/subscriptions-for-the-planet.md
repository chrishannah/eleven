title: Subscriptions for the Planet
---

It's taking many forms at the moment. Still, it's evident that a lot more people are becoming interested in the planet on which we live, and some of them are becoming invested in the various processes in which people are trying to make Earth a better place.

Some choose to protest against global corporations that are performing harmful acts against the environment. Others try to develop small businesses that sell more sustainable goods, and there are loads more.

I am more interested in learning about ecosystems and the various connections between flora and fauna. And I'd like more of these ecosystems to exist. I want humans to learn to live *with* nature again, and therefore our landscapes to go back to how they were many years ago, when the Scottish highlands were full of forests, and there were animals such as the Lynx roaming Britain.

The terms used to describe such goals are "reforestation" and "rewinding". And while I'm not up in the Highlands replanting trees, keeping livestock from destroying more woodland, or campaigning for the return of apex predators. I've found two subscription services essentially, where you can help fund various activities such as reforestation and other climate-related projects. So I thought I'd share some information about them here if anyone else would be interested in helping their causes.

## Ecologi

The first one I'll mention is [Ecologi](https://ecologi.com/). I've had a membership for over six months now, and the work they do around the world is excellent. Their main objectives are to plant trees and to fund the best climate crisis solutions.

A lot of the time, the [projects](https://ecologi.com/projects) are based around reforestation, protecting wildlife, and funding renewable energy projects. A few examples are [protesting forests in Northern Zimbabwe](https://ecologi.com/projects/forest-protection-in-northern-zimbabwe), [preserving prime Brazilian rainforests](https://ecologi.com/projects/preserving-untouched-brazilian-rainforest), and [reforesting a place called Dalry in Scotland](https://ecologi.com/projects/reforesting-dalry-scotland).

How Ecologi works is that as your money funds climate projects and tree planting, you get to visualise this in your digital forest. For example, [my forest of little over 6-months](https://ecologi.com/christopherhannah) has 472 trees and has funded 13.03 tonnes of carbon reduction.

The plans are pretty flexible, and you can add local projects to them. I have the "Booster" plan, which is just £9.40 a month and funds the planting of 24 trees per month and reducing an estimated two carbon footprints per year. I also pay an extra £10.65 a month towards a reforestation project in Scotland, which adds another three trees to their forest.

If that interests you, then I'd recommend [checking them out](https://ecologi.com/), and if you do choose to sign up, then by using [my referral link](https://ecologi.com/christopherhannah), and we'll both receive 30 trees.

## Mossy Earth

Mossy Earth is one that I've only just found, and that was through my research into various rewilding projects. The main aim of all of their projects is to "restore ecosystems and promote biodiversity".

They handle their reforestation and rewilding projects differently. As for the reforestation projects, after they have done enough analysis to decide to proceed with a project and a plan is drawn up, the process is essentially:

1. Trees are planted
2. Photos are taken and GPS coordinates are recorded
3. Trees are assigned to members
4. Trees/Forests are monitored and replanted

A few of their reforestation projects:

- [Restoring the Caledonian Forest in Scotland](https://mossy.earth/projects/reforestation/reforesting-scotland)
- [Restoring native Oak woodlands in areas prone to wildfires](https://mossy.earth/projects/reforestation/oak-woodland-restoration)
- [Restoring floodplain forests along the Danube River in Slovakia](https://mossy.earth/projects/reforestation/restoring-floodplain-forests)


As for the rewilding projects, these actually include members involvement. They start with the same level of analysis, with the result being various projects being drawn up. These projects are then vetted to make sure they fit their criteria. First, to ensure that they fit within the broader context of ecological restoration for that area. Then to ensure that the drivers of degradation are actively addressed.  And finally,  that there is a strategy to monitor the impact of the project and potentially alter the practices used. The projects are then shown to members for approval. Here is the simplified version of that process:

1. Project options researched
2. Members cast votes on what projects should be implemented
3. Projects are implemented
4. Results are monitored and reported

Some of their rewilding projects:

- [Building Eagle nest platforms in the Scottish Highlands](https://mossy.earth/projects/rewilding/building-eagle-nest-platforms)
- [Clearing invasive plants to protect the habitat of the Alaotra Gentle Lemur in Madagascar](https://mossy.earth/projects/rewilding/conserving-lemurs)
- [Protecting Turtle nests and eggs in Slovakia](https://mossy.earth/projects/rewilding/protecting-turtle-nests)

They don't have specific plans like Ecologi but rather do it on a specific monthly contribution. For example, I'm currently paying £10 a month towards their projects, which they say will also go towards planting 48 trees per year.

If you're interested in signing up, then Mossy Earth also has a referral system where they will plant four extra trees for me and you if you [sign up via my link](https://www.mossy.earth/membership?referral=CHRXR9TCRT).

<hr />

I'm delighted these services exist. I find them to be particularly more compelling than simply donating to the equivalent charities. You get regular news and progress reports, which makes you see what your contributions are actually funding.
