title: Feeds Mage
---

The makers of [Mailbrew](https://mailbrew.com/?aff=chrishannah) have crafted yet another great product. This time it's a tool called [Feeds Mage](https://www.feedsmage.com/), that scans your Twitter follows and unearthes any blogs, newsletters, YouTube channels, etc. that might have previously gone unnoticed. And then from there, you can even create a regular email digest from these sources.

I ran this on my own Twitter account, and it found 149 feeds in total. Some were YouTube channels that I already subscribe to, or blogs that I already subscribe to via RSS feeds. But I did manage to find 11 more blogs that I've now added to my RSS reader!
