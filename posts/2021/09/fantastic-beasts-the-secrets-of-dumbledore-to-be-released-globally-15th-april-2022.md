It feels like forever that we've been waiting for this movie, and what's better is that this is only the third instalment of a planned 5 part movie series.

If you want to know a bit more about the plot, then feel free to expand the section below to read a sneak peek at what we're going to see in the film:

    <summary>Plot Sneak Peek</summary>
    <blockquote>Professor Albus Dumbledore knows the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald is moving to seize control of the wizarding world. Unable to stop him alone, he entrusts Magizoologist Newt Scamander to lead an intrepid team of wizards, witches and one brave Muggle baker on a dangerous mission, where they encounter old and new beasts and clash with Grindelwald’s growing legion of followers. But with the stakes so high, how long can Dumbledore remain on the sidelines?</blockquote>

I'm like an absolute child when it comes to Harry Potter, so I already expect that I'll be seeing this multiple times in the cinemas.

Maybe I'll have to rewatch the first two Fantastic Beast movies soon to celebrate?
