title: Is the Portless iPhone Already Here?

Daryl Baxter, [writing at Tech Radar](https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/the-future-of-a-portless-iphone-is-already-here-and-you-own-one):

> Recently we’ve seen Apple take strides in wireless charging, first with the industry-standard Qi charging, followed by its own take with MagSafe charging, starting with the iPhone 12 series in 2020.This only looks to be the start of the portless iPhone, but if you already own an iPhone 12 and above, you may already own a portless smartphone without realising it.

This is an interesting take, and I think I agree with the idea. It’s also why I don’t think USB C ever needs to come to the iPhone.
