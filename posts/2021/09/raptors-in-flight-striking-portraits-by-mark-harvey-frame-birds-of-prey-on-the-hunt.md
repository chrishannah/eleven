title: 'Raptors In Flight: Striking Portraits by Mark Harvey Frame Birds of Prey on
  the Hunt'
---

[Colossal](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2021/09/raptors-in-flight-mark-harvey/):

> Following his portraits of acrobatic birds performing a series of stunts, photographer Mark Harvey turns his focus to the larger, more powerful creatures of the avian species. The new collection, titled Raptors In Flight, centers on birds of prey and their graceful movements while on the hunt. Whether framing a barn owl diving to the ground or a harris hawk splaying its wings, each of the images highlights the raptorsâ€™ unique physical features, making the individual details of their feathers, curved beaks, and eyes visible.

Mark's photos are absolutely stunning. My favourite is definitely the Golden Eagle above. [His Instagram](https://instagram.com/markharveyphoto?utm_medium=copy_link) seems to be full of great photos too.
