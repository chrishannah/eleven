As much as I do like a few parts of this laptop:

- It looks like a Mac.
- Customisable ports.
- Easy to replace components.
- An actual good quality webcam.

You are still limited to running Windows or Linux (or maybe it could be a Hackintosh?). And I have no plans to ever own a Windows or Linux machine.

So it's not for me.

But I still think it's a fascinating idea, and I hope it will become a success, because I really like the idea of being able to repair and upgrade your own computer, and at a reasonable cost.
