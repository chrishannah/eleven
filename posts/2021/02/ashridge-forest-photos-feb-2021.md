title: Ashridge Forest Photos
---

I visited Ashridge earlier today, which is a rather large forest that's only a short car ride from where I live. I didn't miss up the oppurtunity to take my camera, and there was some absolutely incredible light.

My camera is the Fujifilm X-T100, and I used two lenses, the XC 50-230mm zoom lens, and the XC 35mm prime. But I captured a few on my iPhone 12 too, as teh ultra-wide lens seemed perfect for a woodland scene.

After going through a few hundred photos, I came out with 24 that I really like. I've uploaded them all to Flickr, so [you can view the entire album there](https://www.flickr.com/photos/186342532@N04/albums/72157718457122731). But for a quick preview, here are five of my favourites:
