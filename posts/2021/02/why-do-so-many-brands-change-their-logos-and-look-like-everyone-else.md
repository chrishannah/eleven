title: Why Do So Many Brands Change Their Logos and Look Like Everyone Else?
---

Radek Sienkiewicz, [on the Sans-serification (Yes, I just made that up) of modern logos](https://velvetshark.com/articles/why-do-brands-change-their-logos-and-look-like-everyone-else):


<blockquote>
<p>There is a trend in logo design that started around 2017-2018. It’s as if many companies decided that being unique was a handicap and that it was better to be like everyone else. Or at least, that’s how it feels to me.</p><p>The trend started with fashion logos. Many iconic fashion companies ditched their recognizable logos and switched to a bland and very similar version of a sans serif font.</p><p>The technology sector followed soon after.</p></blockquote>

This is a trend that is clearly visible, and I think is part of a bigger trend in modern design. In my opinion we see less personality and originality in logos nowadays. A logo used to be *something*, not just a brand name in a sans-serif font, a specific colour, styled with abnormal capitalisation.

One theory I have, is that it’s part of a brands evolution to progressively make their logo more and more generic. Because maybe they see that as part of becoming a more reputable brand, instead of a small childish company with a trendy logo. Whatever the reason may be, I think I would still prefer to see companies show some personality once in a while.
