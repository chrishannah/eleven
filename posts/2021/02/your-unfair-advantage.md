Matt Birchler, over on his A Better Computer YouTube channel, released [a video on unfair advantages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXEdH9MjJu4), and why you should recognise them and make use of them.

It's fundamentally a simple idea, focussing on what you're good at. But it's true that it's probably not what we focus on. Instead, we think about what we aren't capable of doing, what our disadvantages are, and simply why things are difficult.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I do think there is _something_ for everyone, and we each have our own advantages like Matt points out. It could be a personality trait, a collection of experiences,  knowledge on a particular subject, etc. The only thing that matters is that it's better to focus on what you do well rather than what you do not.
