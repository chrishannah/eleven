title: '''Overtly sexual'' cow blocked as Facebook ad'

<p>What a headline.</p>

<p>Zoe Kleinman, reporting an incredible story about a digital photo gallery owner's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55981602">various experiences with Facebook banning his adverts for seemingly impossible reasons</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Winchester-based photographer's other banned ad images include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a neon sign featuring the word &quot;disco&quot;, on the grounds that it was promoting alcohol</li>
<li>a set of tramlines in Reims, France, which Facebook said went against its ticket sales policy</li>
<li>a Hong Kong skyline, rejected on the grounds that there was &quot;nothing for sale&quot; in the photograph itself</li>
<li><p>a firework display, blocked for promoting weapons</p>
ripples on a pond for selling &quot;adult products&quot;</li>
<li>another &quot;overtly sexual&quot; photo, of a high-rise office building</li>
</ul>
<p>At one point, his entire account was suspended from placing any ads at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know what there is to say about this. Apart from it being absolutely hilarious for reader, but surely massively annoying for the business owner.</p>
