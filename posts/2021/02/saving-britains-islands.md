Joshua Powell, a ZSL PhD student has created a short film about island conservation, called [Saving Britain's Islands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igTGErIpQ5E&feature=youtu.be). The film explores the role of New Zealand and specifically an island called TiriTiri Matangi, in the development of island conservation techniques, and also how these techniques could possibly be used in Britain and other UK islands.
