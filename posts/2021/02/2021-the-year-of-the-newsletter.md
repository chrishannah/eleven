title: '2021: The Year of the Newsletter  ðŸ—ž'
---

Like everyone else nowadays, Iâ€™ve decided to delve into the medium that is the newsletter.

Itâ€™s a medium that has interested me for a while. I appreciate the direct connection between a writer and their audience, which I donâ€™t feel you get from simply reading a blog. I canâ€™t quite put it into words, but thereâ€™s a value to have peoples writing occasionally appear in your inbox. I think newsletters in general bring out the best of email. It feels as if someone has written out a long letter and personally delivered it to you.

Iâ€™m not sure if anyone feels the same way as myself about newsletters. But at least for my newsletter, I want to try and deliver something akin to a personal letter. I havenâ€™t quite decided on the format yet. Iâ€™m currently thinking of a long-form story, with maybe a few extra pieces of news, but that may change.

The one thing I want to keep consistent is a focus on me writing to my audience, and not just treat this as a medium for advertising my projects or filling an issue with tons of links. Thatâ€™s not to say link-based newsletters are bad, I subscribe to a few of them myself. But personally, I would rather share links directly on the blog, and write specifically for a newsletter.

The schedule Iâ€™m going with is monthly. That may seem a bit odd, since the most common seems to be weekly. But I think if I went that way, I would end up either rushing writing, missing weeks, and eventually becoming tired of writing it. This way, I hope I can build up some consistency, and get better at writing longer pieces.

The newsletter will be hosted here on the blog, and if youâ€™re signed in, you will be able to see the issues on the website along with getting them delivered to your inbox.

I would like to say here that while this newsletter is starting off being free, it is an idea of mine to eventually either turn it into a paid newsletter, or at least have a paid option. But any option of that will be a while away, and any decisions will be posted on the blog.

If you like the sound of that, then [please feel free to sign up to my newsletter](https://chrishannah.me/#/portal/signup). I will treat it as an honour to have access to your inbox.
