title: Text Case 2021.3
---

<p>Text Case 2021.3 is a relatively small update, but it brings a few features that users have been desperate for, ever since <a href="https://chrishannah.me/text-case-2021-1/">the major 2021.1 release</a>.</p>

<p>That update introduced the concept of building custom flows, but the flow creator was quite restricted. For example you couldn't easily reorder formats, and also for more complex formats that required custom parameters, there wasn't a way to edit these parameters afterwards.</p>

<p>Fortunately this update fixes both of those limitations. So you can both reorder and edit formats in the flow creator UI.</p>

<p>Additionally to those improvements, I also spent time rewriting the title case logic. That's not going to be something anyone directly cares about. But it allowed me to orient the title case formats around defined rules, and therefore made the process of adding new variants much easier. </p>

<p>Therefore, I've added four new title case variants:</p>

<ul>
<li>AMA Title Case (American Medical Association)</li>
<li>Bluebook Title Case</li>
<li>New York Times Title Case</li>
<li>Wikipedia Title Case</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that Text Case now supports 9 different title case variants. Which if you're interested in, you may want to read the post I wrote recently &quot;<a href="https://chrishannah.me/the-various-types-of-title-case/">The Various Types of Title Case</a>&quot; where I go into detail on all nine.</p>

<p>To top it all off, there is one more new format, Italics. Which means you can now do Bold, Italics, and Bold-Italics in the app.</p>

<p>This update is available right now for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS!</p>
