title: 'Hey World: A Love Letter to Blogs'
---

<p>Hey's new blogging service, <a href="http://world.hey.com">Hey World</a>, is certainly something that has caught my eye recently. I've got some mixed feelings about it, but I do think that it could be a very good alternative for people that don't want to have to go through various hurdles just to publish words on the internet.</p>

<p>Matt Birchler, using the Hey World service, <a href="https://world.hey.com/mattbirchler/hey-world-a-love-letter-to-blogs-a5122f41">seems to have similar feelings</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hey World</strong> looks like it aims to simplify the setup process even more, and remove some of the mental overhead that comes with starting a blog. You don't have to think of a name, find a theme, and figure out what service you're going to use, you can just write an email like you normally would, send it to world@hey.com, and boom you've got a blog post. People can even subscribe to your future posts via email or RSS, so they can follow along easily and however they prefer.</p>

<p>Like Matt, I already run a self-hosted blog, and I'm not thinking about making any major changes anytime soon. However the attitude towards treating newsletters more like personal letters is something I can get behind. It's also one of the main aims I have with my <a href="https://chrishannah.me/newsletter/">newsletter</a>.</p>
