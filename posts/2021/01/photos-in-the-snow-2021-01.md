title: Photos in the Snow
---

It snowed pretty heavily near my house this morning, which meant I _had_ to go out and take some photos.

Luckily for me, there's a small area of woodland just behind my street. So I grabbed my iPhone 12 and my Fujifulm XT100, and went to see what I could capture.

The iPhone 12 seemed to put a green tint on most photos, and sometimes over-exposed the photos. [Halide](https://halide.cam) seemed to work great though.

After playing around in Lightroom, I've got [12 photos that I'm happy with](https://www.flickr.com/photos/186342532@N04/50870077867/in/album-72157718014948461/). They're pretty similar, since they were taken in the same area. But I have tried to give them slightly different looks.

You can [see them all on my Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/186342532@N04/50870077867/in/album-72157718014948461/), but here are my 6 favourites:
