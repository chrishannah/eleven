title: Being Late on the Internet
---

<h1></h1>

<p>The internet can sometimes seem everlasting. Until it's not. And you notice that more when you're late to something.</p>

<p>That happens to me quite a lot.</p>

<p>This time, I've noticed a story involving GameStop, Reddit, and hedge funds. Apparently the Redditors did something together, which made rich people lose money. Or <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>Either way, I was late to the party.</p>

<p>I seemed to find the conversation after everything had happened, it had been picked up in the press, and everyone was offering their hot takes on it.</p>

<p>Maybe it's my personality, but when something gets to that stage, I just ignore it. Sure, I'll most likely see things mentioned on Twitter, so I'll possibly grasp a basic understanding. But I tend to just actively ignore things that I've missed out on, especially when it feels like a lot of effort to go back and understand a situation, that I just don't think will provide me any benefit.</p>

<p>What I need is for someone to say something like &quot;Something interesting happened, X did Y, to do Z, but then A, did B, because of C&quot;. Then I'd say &quot;Oh! That's interesting.&quot;, and move on with my life.</p>

<p>That might sound a tad drastic. But it's honestly how I treat news and events nowadays. </p>

<p>A while ago, I would treat every event and piece of knowledge as something I needed to understand. But recently I've realised that sometimes I'm just not that interested.</p>
