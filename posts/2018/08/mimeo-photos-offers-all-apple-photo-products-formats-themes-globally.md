title: Mimeo Photos Offers All Apple Photo Products, Formats & Themes Globally
---

<p>If you were upset about Apple’s photo printing service no longer being available from the Photos app, you’ll be glad to know that the partner they used, Mimeo, now offer these identical services themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;This is a real opportunity for us to expand our successes as a prominent Apple Photos extension since the beginning,&#8221; said John Delbridge, CEO, Mimeo. &#8220;We are really excited to see an increase in demand from countries like Australia and Japan in addition to our strong US customer base.&#8221;</p>

<p>It’s no longer integrated into the Photos app by default, but there is now the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mimeo-photos/id1282504627?mt=12">Mimeo Photos app</a>, that will make the service available from Apple’s Photos app.</p>
