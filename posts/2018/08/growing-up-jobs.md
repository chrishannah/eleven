<p>Lisa Brennan-Jobs (Daughter of Steve Jobs) has <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/lisa-brennan-jobs-small-fry-steve-jobs-daughter">released an excerpt on Vanity Fair from her book</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Fry-Lisa-Brennan-Jobs/dp/0802128238">Small Fry</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a long read, probably just over 10 minutes, but it’s yet another perspective at Steve’s life that not many would know about.</p>
<p>I can’t quote any single piece from it, I would end up including everything. All I can do is say &#8211; <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/lisa-brennan-jobs-small-fry-steve-jobs-daughter">make sure you read it in it’s entirety</a>.</p>
