title: Yet More Leaks
---

<p>As usual, Apple can’t seem to keep things secret anymore. Leaks are now emerging of the new iPhone XS that will be announced at the event on the 12th September.</p>
<p>I have completely mixed feeling about it this time. It’s a real shame that some of the surprise from the event has been somewhat spoiled. I don’t mind a few bits of information being leaked, but when it’s marketing images of a new product, it feels like someone has really screwed up.</p>
<p>Some people will surely point the blame at the people like 9To5Mac that make these things public, but that’s their job, to release interesting news. And it will certainly interest a lot of people.</p>
<p>I’ve read <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/08/30/2018-iphone-xs-design-larger-version-gold-exclusive/">one article from 9To5Mac</a> which includes an image of the iPhone XS, with new sizes and colour, and I’ve seen a few photos of a new Watch face, but I’m going to try and stay away from anything else. It will be pretty hard, seeing as I follow a lot of blogs that will cover it, and it will be all over Twitter, but I’ll manage.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/_inside">Guilherme Rambo‏</a>, the main investigator of Apple related leaks nowadays, said that <a href="https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1035207167715012608">a lot of information is coming from some test streams</a> that Apple clearly didn’t think people were watching:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Streaming tests started early this year, and with some very good testing material <a href="https://t.co/DFyEa9yUVa">pic.twitter.com/DFyEa9yUVa</a></p>

<p>Apple just can’t seem to keep it in their pants anymore.</p>

<p>I would like to note that I won’t be writing about these leaks, or sharing other links to anything else that may come out. I don’t hold anything against anyone that reads, shares, or does anything with the information. I’ll just try and wait until the official announcement.</p>
