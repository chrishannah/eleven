title: Delete Zuckerberg?
---

<p>As most people may already know, Facebook have been doing some more creepy things with your data. This times it’s sending any phone numbers used for two-factor authentication, to advertisers, so they can use that as another targeting mechanism. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/27/yes-facebook-is-using-your-2fa-phone-number-to-target-you-with-ads/?sr_share=twitter&amp;utm_source=tctwreshare&amp;guccounter=1">TechCrunch have a great article about this</a> if you want to read more.</p>
<p>Bloomberg have made the situation a bit more interesting with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-28/indie-hacker-declares-he-ll-live-stream-an-attack-on-zuckerberg">their article</a> though, as apparently a Taiwanese hacker, plans on deleting Mark Zuckerbergs Facebook profile. And he plans on broadcasting it live. On Facebook!  I’m definitely going to tune in to see what happens with this one!</p>
<p>It’s scheduled to happen at 18:00 (Taiwan local time) this Sunday (30th September). <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Zuckerberg&amp;iso=20180930T18&amp;p1=241">You can find your exact localised time here</a>.</p>
