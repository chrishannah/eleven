title: Text Case 1.3
---

<p>It’s been under two weeks since <a href="https://chrishannah.me/text-case-12/">Text Case received its 1.2 update</a>, which contained improvements to title case formatting, and a couple extra formats.</p>
<p>Well in this update, Text Case will now be accessible via Siri! And you will also get to set a different accent colour in the app.</p>
<h2>Accent Colour</h2>

<p>There’s not that much UI in Text Case, as it’s been intentionally kept rather simple. However there are now 6 colours, that will be used for the navigation bar, switches, and buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pink (Default)</li>
<li>Orange</li>
<li>Blue</li>
<li>Green</li>
<li>Purple</li>
<li>Black</li>
</ul>
<h2>Siri Support</h2>
<p>With iOS 12 now being released, Siri has gotten a whole lot more powerful, and you’ll expect quite a lot of apps to try and make use of it. Which meant I just had to add support to Text Case.</p>
<p>There’s only one function in Text Case, and that is to convert text into various different formats. And that means it’s also really easy to use! The formats will be applied to any text that you have copied, and the formatted text will replace it on the clipboard, ready for you to paste anywhere.</p>
<p>From Settings, you will find the “Add to Siri” option at the bottom. If you tap this, you will then get to select a format, and then record a custom phrase.</p>

<h3>Siri Shortcuts</h3>
<p>That’s not all the ways you can use Text Case with Siri. Because as you use Text Case, iOS will learn what formats you are using, and begin to suggest them to you.</p>
<p>These suggestions will also appear in the new Siri Shortcuts app, where you will be able to automate them with everything else!</p>
<p>Here’s just a few examples:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6310" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Image.jpeg" width="2233" height="1960" srcset="https://chrishannah.me/images/2018/09/Image.jpeg 2233w, https://chrishannah.me/images/2018/09/Image-300x263.jpeg 300w, https://chrishannah.me/images/2018/09/Image-768x674.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 2233px) 100vw, 2233px" /></p>
