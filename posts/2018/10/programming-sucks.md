title: Programming Sucks
---

<p>I just read one the <a href="https://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks">funniest and accurate essays by Peter Welch</a>, which was <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1050121042520289281">shared by Sarah Drasner on Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every friend I have with a job that involves picking up something heavier than a laptop more than twice a week eventually finds a way to slip something like this into conversation: “Bro, you don’t work hard. I just worked a 4700-hour week digging a tunnel under Mordor with a screwdriver.”</p>
<p>They have a point. Mordor sucks, and it’s certainly more physically taxing to dig a tunnel than poke at a keyboard unless you’re an ant. But, for the sake of the argument, can we agree that stress and insanity are bad things? Awesome. Welcome to programming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was published over four years ago (April 27th, 2014), but it’s interesting to see how relevant all the points still are. If you have 10 minutes to spare, then I highly recommend <a href="https://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks">giving this a read</a>.</p>
<p>I’m definitely adding this blog to my RSS reader for future reading.</p>
