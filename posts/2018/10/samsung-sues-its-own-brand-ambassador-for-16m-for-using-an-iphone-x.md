title: Samsung sues its own brand ambassador for $1.6M for using an iPhone X

<p>Ben Lovejoy, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/24/using-an-iphone/">writing for 9To5Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Itâ€™s not unusual for celebrities paid to promote Android brands to be caught using an iPhone. In many cases, they have been caught out on Twitter â€“ like Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot.</p>
<p>  But Samsung appears to take the matter more seriously than most: they are suing their own Russian brand ambassador for using an iPhone X for a massive $1.6M â€¦</p>
<p>  Reality TV show host and politician Ksenia Sobchak is the face of Samsung in Russia, and is required by contract to use a Samsung smartphone. But the Mirror reports that she was seen on a television interview using an iPhone X.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t blame them. Who would, given the option, use a Samsung phone ðŸ˜œ.</p>
<p>However, youâ€™d probably either make a better effort to hide it, or just not become a Brand Ambassador.</p>
