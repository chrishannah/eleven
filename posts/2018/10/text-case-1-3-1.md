<p>Another update to <a href="https://chrishannah.me/projects/text-case/">Text Case</a> has just hit the store!</p>
<p>  Just a small one this time though, to tie up a few things, before anything big can be planned or worked on. In fact it can be boiled down to three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new text format, this time it’s <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase">KebabCase</a>. And as usual it was requested, so I added it! There’s no chance that I can come up with every format possible, so if you want one added then please just <a href="https://chrishannah.me/">let me know</a>.</li>
<li>About section added (website links, App Store link, app version…)</li>
<li>And I’ve fixed a bug in the Action Extension. As the UI used to inherit some of the styles from the encompassing app, but it wouldn’t always look correct. I’ve fixed this by keeping it matching with the rest of the app, along with the chosen accent colour.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not an extravagant update, but then again, they can’t all be.</p>
