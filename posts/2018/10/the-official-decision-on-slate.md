title: The Official Decision on Slate
---

<p>It’s been in my head for a while, but I’m finally making my decision about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/category/slate-development-log/">Slate</a> official. If you weren’t already aware of what Slate actually is (was), it’s an iOS app for the <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog platform</a>. I’ve spent quite a lot of time working on it, and I used to use it quite a lot myself, as it was <em>good enough</em> for reading posts, and also publishing text-only posts.</p>
<p>I always knew the next steps for the app. The main things I planned to work on next were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image uploading</li>
<li>Markdown preview when composing posts</li>
<li>Faster timeline parsing/scrolling</li>
<li>A caching mechanism for timelines</li>
<li>Support for non-Micro.blog micro blogs</li>
</ul>
<p>These are totally achievable features, and it’s what I classed as being necessary before being able to release it as a public app (It’s currently been in TestFlight beta for months).</p>
<p>But about two or three months ago, I basically stopped using Micro.blog. I transitioned my posts over here, but I still planned on using the service but have it tied to one blog. I’m not sure what really made me stop using it, but it sort of faded over a long period of time, and I didn’t feel like missing anything, so I didn’t go back.</p>
<p>This all tied in with me slowing down on the development of Slate. Although I was still doing occasional small updates, and it was in my head that I would soon spend some time on the bigger features that I wanted to implement. But the time never came. And I became less interested in building an app for a service that I wasn’t using anymore.</p>
<p>It also combined with me starting to focus on good UX in my apps, and trying to really create great experiences. And as a user of Tweetbot (Twitter client for iOS and macOS), I didn’t think I would realistically be bale to put the time and effort into making a great app for Micro.blog.</p>
<p>So after a huge chunk of time (probably just over two months), I’ve decided that I will no longer work on Slate. And at least for the foreseeable future, I don’t see myself touching the code at all. <br />
It doesn’t mean I’m completely over with Micro.blog, the platform, though. I’ve listened to the <a href="https://micro.blog/monday">Micro Monday podcast</a>, where Jean MacDonald, the community manager, talks to members of the Micro.blog community), pretty regularly. Even since stopping using the service. And it still sounds like Micro.blog is a nice place to be, with loads of interesting people. So there’s a possibility of me returning as a normal user, but very unlikely that I’ll work on Slate again!</p>
<p>If you want to find me on Micro.blog, I am still under the username <a href="http://micro.blog/chrishannah">chrishannah</a>. However, the only content that gets posted there currently is the RSS feed of this blog. But that’s where I’ll be if I return.</p>
