title: Customers, Not Users
---

<p><a href="https://audaciousfox.net/2018/customers-vs-users">K.Q. Dreger, writing for Audacious Fox</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of software isn’t free. Plenty of people pay to use products. Yet, we call these people users in most of our copy and internal communications. Should we?</p>
<p>What if we tried calling them what they actually are: customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I strongly believe everything he says in this article.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many people list reasons why you should refer to customers of your product/service a user, whether it’s a blog post, on Twitter, or even on laptop stickers. I however, prefer the term customer.</p>
<p>The way the word “user” gets thrown about always feels pretty weak, and it just seems like a bit of a <em>nice word</em>. It means you treat them simply as people that <em>use</em> something that you’re offering. But what if they’ve paid you for that thing? Surely they you should grant them a bit of respect and refer to them as why they actually are, a paying customer.</p>
