title: Now Is the Perfect Time for an RSS Renaissance
---

<blockquote><p>
That might sound silly today, in an era of centralized services (e.g. Facebook, Google) bombarding our inboxes, phones, and &#8220;feeds&#8221;. As privacy and security breaches make headlines, we clamor for a decentralized internet. But less than twenty years ago, the internet was decentralized, when the human cycle of individualism versus collectivism was perfectly aligned with divergent expression. We&#8217;ve now spent the past decade attempting to build the perfect centralized web, only to realize its many faults. The cycle continues.

<p>Itâ€™s just one big cycle.</p>
