<p>Just a small update today. But Slate, now has three full themes!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="4378" height="2948" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1215" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/F1B8B854-4026-44E3-96EB-AD76CA67D291.png" srcset="https://chrishannah.me/images/2018/04/F1B8B854-4026-44E3-96EB-AD76CA67D291.png 4378w, https://chrishannah.me/images/2018/04/F1B8B854-4026-44E3-96EB-AD76CA67D291-300x202.png 300w, https://chrishannah.me/images/2018/04/F1B8B854-4026-44E3-96EB-AD76CA67D291-768x517.png 768w, https://chrishannah.me/images/2018/04/F1B8B854-4026-44E3-96EB-AD76CA67D291-1024x690.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 4378px) 100vw, 4378px" /></p>
<p>You can choose from Light, Dark, and Black. And it changes live when you toggle between them!</p>
<p>I’ve noticed a few issues coming my image caching system, which is what I’ll be focusing on next. After that is sorted, I’ll have to get inline images working properly, which is the last thing I have planned for this beta build!</p>
<p>Just a reminder: The beta is completely open, and all I require is an email address to send the TestFlight invite. Feel free to <a href="mailto:me@chrishannah.me">email me</a>, or find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://micro.blog/chrishannah">Micro.blog</a>.</p>
