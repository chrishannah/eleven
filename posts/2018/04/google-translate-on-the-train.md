title: Google Translate on the Train
---

<p>Someone on the train is talking about an exciting new app that a friend of his discovered. It lets you translate words from other languages, so you can pass a phone around your friends while you’re in a restaurant, so you can read the menu.</p>
<p>He then followed up with: “I think it’s Google Translate”. Completely as if he had never heard of Google, or the ability to translate words.</p>
