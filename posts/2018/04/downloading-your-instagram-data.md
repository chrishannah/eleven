title: Downloading Your Instagram Data
---

<p>Many people, including myself, are trying to move away from Facebook and their related apps/services. But before you delete any accounts, it’s obviously ideal if you can retrieve any data first.</p>
<p>With Instagram, you can request to download your data, and they’ll send a link where you can download all your images, videos, and stories.</p>
<p>You also get <code>.json</code> files for a lot of the associated data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profile</li>
<li>Comments</li>
<li>Connections</li>
<li>Likes</li>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>Searches</li>
<li>Settings</li>
</ul>
<p>So they really do give you everything!</p>
<p>To download your data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Instagram website.</li>
<li>Click on the profile icon in the top right.</li>
<li>Click on the Settings cog next to “Exit Profile”.</li>
<li>Choose “Privacy and Security”.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the “Data Download” section.</li>
<li>Click “Request Download”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instagram will then package up all your data, and send you an email with a link to the .zip archive.</p>
