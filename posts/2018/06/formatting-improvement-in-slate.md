title: Formatting Improvement in Slate
---

<p>A massive improvement has just been made to Slate! I’ve found a new way to convert the html content of a post into a format the app can read.</p>
<p>It’s so much faster, actually supports things like bold and italics, lists appear how you’d expect them to, and also doesn’t mess around with extra line breaks!</p>
<p>The speed increase is what about shocked me though, because the old method took about the same time it took to request the actual data from the Micro blog api. It was only ever a temporary solution, but this works near instantly.</p>
