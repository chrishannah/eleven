title: Text Case Has Been Released!
---

<p>I’m very glad to announce that Text Case is now released, and is live on the App Store!</p>
<p>Text Case is a simple utility that allows you to convert any text into various different formats.</p>
<p>It comes packed with an action extension that lets you select text anywhere in iOS, tap the Share button, and then you’ll find the “Convert Text” action. This will show you a preview of all available formats, and a simple tap on one of those will copy it to your clipboard, and you’ll be returned to the original app.</p>
<p>The available formats are currently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title Case</li>
<li>URL Encoded</li>
<li>Uppercase</li>
<li>Lowercase</li>
<li>Capitalise</li>
<li>Reversed</li>
<li>Mocking Spongebob (This one is for fun)</li>
</ul>
<p>More formats will be added in the future!</p>
