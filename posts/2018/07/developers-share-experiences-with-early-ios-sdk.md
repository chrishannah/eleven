title: Developers Share Experiences With Early iOS SDK
---

<p>With all the nostalgia of the early App Store and iOS SDK days, Frederik Riedel <a href="https://twitter.com/frederikRiedel/status/1016751745773555714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1016751745773555714&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Friedel.wtf%2F2018%2F07%2F11%2Fhappy-10th-birthday-appstore%2F">tweeted about his experience developing iRedstone</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When I created iRedstone, I had no idea what object oriented programming was. I had no idea what a ViewController was. It was all in one UIView. But it worked. You don‚Äôt have to be an engineer to create apps.</p>

<p>After he tweeted that, other developers started quoting it, and sharing their experiences. Frederik has compiled a <a href="https://riedel.wtf/2018/07/11/happy-10th-birthday-appstore/">great collection of them over on his blog</a>.</p>
