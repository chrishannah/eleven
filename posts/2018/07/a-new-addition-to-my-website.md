title: A new addition to my website
---

<p>I&#8217;ve made a long needed addition to my blog, a sidebar. I&#8217;ve been restricted to the top nav bar for a while now, and it&#8217;s been a pain to keep it simple but also have all the needed links.</p>
<p>Now I use the top main bar for high level links such as home, micro blog, projects page, etc. And the sidebar houses a few social icons, featured sections on the blog, and also a few links to my current projects.</p>
<p>I see this section being very helpful.</p>
