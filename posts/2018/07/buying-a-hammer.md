title: Buying a Hammer
---

<p><a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/buying-a-hammer/">Matt Birchler at his finest</a>, turning a subject such as buying a hammer into a thought provoking piece about making judgements upon people’s tech purchases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re certainly not going to shop around from store to store for the best hammer deal. You’re not going to watch YouTube videos demoing an array of hammers, and you’re not going to read reviews for the top 5 hammers this season. You’re certainly not going to check to see if Craftsman is going to release a new hammer in the next few months that will be better than what’s on the shelves now.</p>
<p>Nope, you’re not going to do any of that, you’re going to go to the store, pick one that seems fine (they all seem fine, don’t they?), make sure it’s one of the cheaper ones available, and get on with your life.</p>
