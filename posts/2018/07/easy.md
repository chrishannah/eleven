<p>Eric Schwarz, writing about <a href="https://schwarztech.net/articles/easy">the perspective that outsiders can have on the difficulty of skilled roles</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There seems to be a notion from those that are not technologically-inclined that anyone who works with technology can easily do anything, be it a desktop support technician, network engineer, database administrator, programmer, designer, etc. I’ve always taken it as a bit of a compliment that my skill set is valued and that I am seen as a resource, but increasingly the expectation of more impossible demands from outside parties has been coming across my desk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have definitely experienced this, and I’m sure people in a wide range of professions experience something similar.</p>
