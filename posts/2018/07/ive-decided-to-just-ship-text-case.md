title: I’ve Decided to “Just Ship” Text Case
---

<p>I’ve been working on a small project called Text Case for a while now. It’s had my attention in small bursts, and I think it’s finally ready to be classified as a 1.0.</p>
<p>I won’t write a whole essay about it just yet, but it’s a utility app that converts raw text into various different formats. The main one being title case, which is very handy for me personally.</p>
<p>Along with the base app, it comes with an Action Extension, which you can access by selecting a portion of text, and then accessing the Share sheet. You then get to preview the possible formatted versions, and just one tap will copy it to the clipboard, and it’s dismissed.</p>
<p>I can already think about different ways the app can be expanded, but I don’t want this to become a habit of mine, where I never ship something because I always want to add one extra thing. There’s definitely going to be edge cases where formatting won’t be perfect, I’m thinking the title case will be 100% of these, but I can fix these quite fast.</p>
<p>But for once, I’m just going to ship an app, and see how it’s goes.</p>
<p>Here’s a preview:</p>
