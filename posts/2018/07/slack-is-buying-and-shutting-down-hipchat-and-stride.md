title: Slack is buying, and shutting down, HipChat and Stride

<p>Greg Kumparak,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/atlassians-hipchat-and-stride-to-be-discontinued-with-slack-buying-up-the-ip/"> writing for Tech Crunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HipChat, the workplace chat app that held the throne before Slack was Slack, is being discontinued. Also being discontinued is Atlassian’s own would-be HipChat replacement, Stride.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m so happy about this. I use HipChat at work, because the company is invested in all of the Atlassian ecosystem. I&#8217;d much rather use Slack.</p>
