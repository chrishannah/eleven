title: I don't like using external monitors anymore
---

<p>When I started my first job as an iOS Developer just over a year ago, I was really excited about my two 23‚Äù monitors on my desk. I had every app I&#8217;d need for the entire day open and visible for 8 hours.</p>
<p>The past month or so I&#8217;ve started to find myself disconnecting my MacBook to eliminate distraction, and it&#8217;s certainly working. I find it a lot easier to to focus on what I&#8217;m doing if I just have the one window visible.</p>
<p>I could probably just use the one monitor, and keep it minimal with one app always in full screen mode. But I think I just <em>enjoy</em> using a laptop more. It could be down to the fact that I&#8217;ve never owned a desktop computer before though, as for the last 10 years I&#8217;ve always used 13&#8243; MacBooks.</p>
<p>It feels right to me to do all my work on this small laptop, but it certainly sounds weird in my head.</p>
