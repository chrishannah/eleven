<p>I’m working on an app at work where I’m regularly implementing new sections/views. And I’ve become really fond of the “native” design look.<br />
It’s something I’ve tried to do with TextCase and Slate, but it’s now spreading to my actual job.</p>
<p>I think it’s down to two facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I like Apples design for apps.</li>
<li>I don’t think users should have to “learn” a user interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s also a whole bunch of benefits you get from using native controls, such as accessibility support, and standard designs for certain contexts. An example of that is a system alert, where you specify if an action is a “cancel”, “destructive”, or “default”, and then the formatting is applied.</p>
<p>I’m not doing this as a way to make the apps feel more generic though, as I’m making use of accent colours, and in some cases, fonts, to make sure the “branding” still comes through.</p>
