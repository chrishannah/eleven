title: New Dynamic Wallpaper in macOS Mojave Beta 4
---

<p>I’ve just upgraded my Mac to the latest Mojave beta, and I’ve discovered a new wallpaper!</p>
<p>In a previous update the Desktop Pictures folder was split into two sections &#8211; Dynamic Desktop and Desktop Pictures. The first section containing the photo of the Mojave desert, which contained a dynamic, and two still (night and day) versions.</p>
<p>This new one is called “Solar gradients” and comes in just a dynamic format. Of course it’s a rather simple wallpaper, and the majority of the time it’s a two-colour gradient, but it will show you the sun rising, the sky getting brighter, followed by the sun fading away, and a darker blue and black combination for the night sky.</p>

<p>A quick tip &#8211; If you want to preview a dynamic desktop, when you navigate to the Desktop &amp; Screen Saver pane in System Preferences, just select the wallpaper, and the preview image will cycle through the different segments.</p>
