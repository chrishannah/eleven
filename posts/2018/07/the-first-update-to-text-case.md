title: The First Update to Text Case
---

<p>It hasn’t been long since the release of <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1407730596?at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=MAC&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8">Text Case</a>, but I’ve already had some great suggestions, so I decided to add them in!</p>
<p>So here it goes.</p>
<p>Five extra formats: &#8211; URL Decoded &#8211; Capitalise All Words &#8211; Camel Case &#8211; Snake Case &#8211; Hashtags</p>
<p>One format has been “fixed”, and that is Capitalise. It now does the obvious and also capitalises the first letter after a period.</p>
<p>You can now choose which formats you want to enable, by navigating to the Settings page, and flipping the switches. This will obviously allow for a more customised interface, as I imagine some people won’t want all 12 formats to show if there aren’t needed.</p>
<p>I still have two things I want to work on. One is the ability for the action extension to be able to replace the original selected text with the new converted value. The other is a pretty great idea that I can’t share until I figure out how exactly I’m going to implement it. But it will be an advanced feature.</p>
<p>I’d also like to say thank you to everyone that has already downloaded Text Case, and I plan to keep adding useful updates!</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, you can <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1407730596?at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=MAC&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8">download Text Case on the App Store</a>.</p>
