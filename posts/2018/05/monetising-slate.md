title: Monetising Slate
---

<p>Although I&#8217;m not thinking it about it too much right now, I&#8217;m not completely sure how Slate will be monetised in the future.</p>
<p>I would like to offer Slate as a free app, like Icro.</p>
<p>My first idea is to put a &#8220;Tip Jar&#8221; style feature in Slate after it is released. And then maybe it can be paid in the future? I&#8217;m not sure about how well that would be received though.</p>
<p>For now, Iâ€™ve set up a &#8220;Buy me a coffee&#8221; page, as I thought that was a simpler solution right now. I&#8217;m not trying to use this to request anything, but it&#8217;s just out there as a way to support the development.</p>
