<ul>
<li>A working Xcode that doesn’t have SourceKit crashing every 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Always on Apple Watch face.</li>
<li>Declarative UI framework.</li>
<li>Dark mode for iOS.</li>
<li>Better Notification Center.</li>
<li>Maybe some UI changes so that iOS isn’t exactly the same as always.</li>
<li>Widgets on the home screen.</li>
</ul>
