title: How to Create File Templates on Your Mac With Finder's Stationery Pad Feature
---

<p>Tim Hardwick, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/mac-file-templates-finder-stationery-pad/">writing for Mac Rumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stationery Pad is a handy way to nix a step in your workflow if you regularly use document templates on your Mac. The long-standing Finder feature essentially tells a file&#8217;s parent application to open a copy of it by default, ensuring that the original file remains unedited.</p>
<p>Stationery Pad doesn&#8217;t get much attention these days, but it&#8217;s a neat alternative to repeatedly editing templates and using the &#8220;Save As&#8230;&#8221; command, which can lead to overwriting the original file if you&#8217;re not too careful.</p>

<p>I had no idea this existed. I will most certainly be making use of it in the future.</p>
