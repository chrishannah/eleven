title: .App Domains Are Coming!
---

<p>Google have <a href="https://www.blog.google/topics/developers/introducing-app-more-secure-home-apps-web/">announced another top-level domain from Google Registry</a>, specifically for apps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we’re announcing .app, the newest top-level domain (TLD) from Google Registry.</p>
<p>A TLD is the last part of a domain name, like .com in “www.google.com” or .google in “blog.google” (the site you’re on right now). We created the .app TLD specifically for apps and app developers, with added security to help you showcase your apps to the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This just <em>makes sense</em>. It’s obvious that this had to happen one day, and I’m very glad it has. Especially when you mention apps on things like Twitter like “Mail.app”, so technically there’s a possibility that url may actually work.</p>
<p>One security benefit is that HTTPS is required for all .app domains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your security is our priority. The .app top-level domain is included on the HSTS preload list, making HTTPS required on all connections to .app websites — no individual HSTS registration or configuration required. The result is built-in web security for you and your users. &#8211; <a href="https://get.app/#benefits">get.app</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can check if a .app domain is available on get.app right now, and the general availability will be on 8th May 2018. Although some domain registrars are selling “early access” to domains, which means that you will essentially reserve a name, so a registrar will try to purchase it as soon as it’s available. I’m not exactly a big fan of this, but what can I do. What’s worse is that <a href="https://uk.godaddy.com/tlds/app-domain">GoDaddy are selling multiple levels of priority</a>.</p>
<p>I would like to get Slate.app, but the cheapest I’ve seen it €145 per year. Not exactly what I wanted to spend.</p>
