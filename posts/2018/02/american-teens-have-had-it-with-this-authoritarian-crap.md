title: American teens have had it with this authoritarian crap
---

<p>Jason Kottke, writing about <a href="https://kottke.org/18/02/american-teens-have-had-it-with-this-authoritarian-crap">a few experiments where totalitarian regimes were tested in some schools</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The nation’s youth, raised on The Hunger Games and Harry Potter, are reminding the baby boomers that considering what their own parents went through in the Great Depression and World War II, they should fucking know better than to slam the door on succeeding generations.</p></blockquote>
<p>That was the bit I laughed at. But overall it’s an intriguing idea.</p>
