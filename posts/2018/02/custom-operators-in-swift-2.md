title: Custom operators in Swift
---

<p>John Sundell has written a great piece about <a href="https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/custom-operators-in-swift">using custom operators in Swift</a>. Some really interesting examples as well. I never really thought about custom operators like he has, but clearly they can be very powerful tools:</p>

<p>Love &#8217;em or hate &#8217;em &#8211; either way there are some really interesting things that we can do with custom operators &#8211; whether we are overloading existing ones or defining our own. This week, let&#8217;s take a look at a few situations that custom operators could be used in, and some of the pros &amp; cons of using them.</p></blockquote>
