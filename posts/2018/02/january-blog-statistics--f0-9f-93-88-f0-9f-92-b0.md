title: January Blog Statistics ðŸ“ˆðŸ’°
---

<p>After signing up my blog for Carbon Ads at the start of January, Iâ€™ve just had my first set of earnings calculated!</p>
<p>Maybe some people wouldnâ€™t make this sort of thing public, but itâ€™s on such a small scale thereâ€™s nothing really to hide.</p>
<p>Here are the stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>3087 Impressions</li>
<li>5 Clicks</li>
<li>0.162% Overall CTR</li>
<li>$7.58 Payout</li>
</ul>
<p>So itâ€™s nothing really, but itâ€™s my first ever payment from ads, and my blog costs $10 to run. So itâ€™s not actually far off!</p>
<p>Itâ€™s certainly a motivational push, to make me post more, and better content!</p>
