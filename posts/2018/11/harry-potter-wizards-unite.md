title: 'Harry Potter: Wizards Unite'
---

<p>Over a year ago, Niantic (the developers behind Pokémon GO) <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/wizardsunite/">announced a game called Wizards Unite</a>. In their announcement, they celebrated the state of their AR technology, including how successful Pokémon GO already was at that point (November 2017). It meant that they had the ability to expand on that and create an experience for the Harry Potter franchise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re incredibly excited to announce this next step in the evolution of AR mobile entertainment. With Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, players that have been dreaming of becoming real life Wizards will finally get the chance to experience J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World. Players will learn spells, explore their real world neighborhoods and cities to discover &amp; fight legendary beasts and team up with others to take down powerful enemies. We&#8217;re thrilled to partner with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, and WB Games San Francisco’s development team to bring this magical and beloved series to life in a brand new way. Harry Potter: Wizards Unite will leverage the full stack of the Niantic Platform while also providing an opportunity to pioneer all new technology and gameplay mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounded really impressive, but I didn’t expect it to take this long. Because we’ve only just been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzQDoPUcvmE">treated to a trailer</a>, and it wont be released until 2019.</p>

<p>The story sounds reasonably interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ministry is looking for witches and wizards willing to roll up their sleeves and volunteer to save the wizarding world from the Calamity. As a member of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force (a new task force formed in partnership between the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards) you will hone lightning fast wand reflexes, an ability to sniff out the faintest whiff of magical disorder from afar, and proficiency in advanced casting of multiple spells.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it will all depend on the implementation of the real world scaling, the AR features, and just how it will be played. The idea of Pokémon works very well in this scenario, and Pokémon GO has only proved that. But I’m not sure how you could get a game based around the Harry Potter franchise, that is constantly pulling you in to do more, without it being a fixed storyline.</p>
<p>I’m a <strong>big</strong> Harry Potter fan, so I’m going to play it no matter what. But I hope it’s something long lasting.</p>
