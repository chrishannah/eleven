<p>Pretty Regular Expressions, the iOS app, has never and currently does not collect, use, or interact with at all, any personal and private information stored on the device.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no need for Pretty Regular Expressions to ever interact with anything, apart from the direct text that it is performing regular expressions upon, and for that reason alone, there has never been any intention to use personal or private information.</p>
<p><em><strong>Date Effective</strong>: 29th November 2018</em></p>
