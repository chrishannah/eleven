title: Irish Football Club Announced Player Dead After Returning to Spain
---

<p>A <a href="https://onefootball.com/en/news/irish-club-apologises-after-falsely-reporting-death-of-player-en-22881131?variable=20181128">very funny article on OneFootball</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Irish football club has apologised after falsely reporting a player had died, which prompted the postponement of their own match and a minute&#8217;s silence to be held at others.</p>
<p>  Ballybrack claimed Fernando Nuno La Fuente had been killed in a road traffic accident and their Leinster Senior League (LSL) clash with Arklow Town on Saturday was suspended as a result.</p>
<p>  But it later transpired that the Spanish player was, in fact, still alive and had returned to his homeland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What an absolute screw up.</p>
