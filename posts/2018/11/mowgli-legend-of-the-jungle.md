title: 'Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle'
---

<p>It must be movie trailer season, because here’s another film that I already <em>need</em> to see! It’s a live-action version of the classic, Jungle Book. If it follows in the same vein that the most recent Tarzan film did, then I imagine it will be a huge success. At least, for me it will be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acclaimed actor and director Andy Serkis reinvents Rudyard Kipling’s beloved masterpiece, in which a boy torn between two worlds accepts his destiny and becomes a legend. Mowgli has never truly belonged in either the wilds of the jungle or the civilized world of man. Now he must navigate the inherent dangers of each on a journey to discover where he truly belongs. &#8211; Netflix</p>
