title: A Giant Cow Called Knickers Is So Large It Actually Saved His Life
---

<p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/28/people-are-obsessed-with-a-very-large-cow-called-knickers-8185333/">Ellen Scott, writing for Metro</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over in Australia lives a very large cow.</p>
<p>Or, if we’re being technically accurate, a very large steer, which is a neutered male.</p>
<p>His name is Knickers.</p>
<p>He is 6 ft 4in tall standing and weighs 1,400kg. That’s actually a tiny bit shorter than the steer that holds the world record for size, Bellino, who lives in Italy, but it is still very, very large.</p>
<p>So large, in fact, that he’s too big to be killed and sold as meat. Meat processors say they just can’t take him as he’s too large for them to deal with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Holy Cow.</p>
