<p>Apparently there’s no limit to the amount of David Attenborough we can watch.</p>
<p>Just after the first episode of Dynasties has aired, there’s already news of a new series that will focus on the planet as a whole, and how everything is connected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the creator of &#8220;Planet Earth,&#8221; &#8220;Our Planet&#8221; series takes viewers on an unprecedented journey through some of the world&#8217;s most precious natural habitats, narrated by Sir David Attenborough. Launching globally on Netflix April 5, 2019. &#8211; Netflix</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing I’m already wondering about, is the scope of it all. I can imagine that Netflix is providing a huge budget, especially as it will be hugely available to watch. But the BBC have had Planet Earth, Blue Planet, and now Dynasties, so there not exactly lacking on budget or expertise.</p>
<p>Then there’s the actual content, it’s hard to imagine something that David Attenborough hasn’t told us about. But then again, he’s not failed us yet.</p>
