<p>I did not expect this film at all. You get to see Pokémon actually in the real world!</p>
<p>It’s a bit weird hearing Pikachu talk, and maybe even weirder that it’s Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool) as the voice actor.</p>
<p>There were certainly some cool things that I noticed (spoilers!):</p>
<ul>
<li>Pikachu looks like a teddy.</li>
<li>Psyduck has fur. </li>
<li>There’s an army of Bulbasaur!</li>
<li>Mr. Mime is an actual mime.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s based in “Ryme City”.</li>
<li>The main character (Harry Goodman) received a train ticket demo Leaventown to Ryme City on his 21st birthday. Pokémon trainers usually start their journey when they’re 10. </li>
<li>Jigglypuff isn’t very effective at maintaining an awake audience at Karaoke.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, there is actually already a <a href="https://detectivepikachu.pokemon.com/en-us/">Detective Pikachu game for the Nintendo 3DS</a>.</p>
