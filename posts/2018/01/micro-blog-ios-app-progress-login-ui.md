title: Micro Blog iOS App Progress - Login UI
---

<p>I thought I&#8217;d do some more work on my Micro.blog iOS client this evening. So far it can only view the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timeline</li>
<li>Mentions</li>
<li>Discover</li>
<li>Favourites</li>
</ul>
<p>The code however, is probably the best I&#8217;ve ever written. I&#8217;ve kept it pretty generic, and it&#8217;s something that can definitely be expanded upon pretty quickly now.</p>
<p>What I worked on tonight, was the interface and some of the error handling for the initial login page. I want to support logging in by a Micro.blog username/password, but also by a direct app token.</p>
<p>It is at the minute, a strict <strong>Micro.blog client</strong>, because I don&#8217;t plan on developing a whole blogging application. However I will look into that decision in the future.</p>
<p>For now, here&#8217;s a preview of the Login page:</p>
