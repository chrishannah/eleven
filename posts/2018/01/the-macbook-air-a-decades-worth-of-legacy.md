<p>Stephen Hackett, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/mac/the-macbook-air-a-decades-worth-of-legacy/">writing in his MacStories column</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, all of our notebooks are thin and light. We’ve traded our optical drives in for a series dongles and our spinning hard drives for fast, silent SSDs.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always like this. Once upon a time, notebooks had optical drives and a full array of ports, complemented by features like removable batteries.</p>
<p>A decade ago, we entered the current era of notebook design when Steve Jobs pulled the future out of an envelope.</p></blockquote>
<p>The MacBook Air was a real astonishing product when it first launched, and the envelope presentation shocked quite a lot of people.</p>
<p>Stephen, goes into a lot of detail in his article, where he discusses things like the overall design, the IO it had, and also some of the issues it had.</p>
<p>Along with the article, he also produced another of his insightful videos:</p>
