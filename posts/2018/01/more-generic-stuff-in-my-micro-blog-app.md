title: More Generic Stuff in My Micro.blog App
---

<p>Started some pretty cool stuff in my Micro.blog app last night &#8211; generic views for lists of posts!</p>
<p>I already had it working for lists of users, but with the posts, I should be able to add conversations, and other stuff quite easily.</p>
<p>After that, I&#8217;m going to work on a generic view for an individual post and user. And then make the navigation much more simple, so whatever you tap on, whether it&#8217;s a post in a list, or a userâ€™s photo in a post, the app will detect the context, and present you with the relevant view to show more details about that.</p>
<p>Basically, it will allow for much more user friendly navigation, and hopefully with not too much work!</p>
