title: What I Wish the iPad Would Gain from the Mac
---

<p>Ryan Christoffel wrote a great piece over at MacStories, about <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/what-i-wish-the-ipad-would-gain-from-the-mac/">what he wants to see the iPad gain from the Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I made the iPad Pro my primary computer when it first launched in late 2015. The transition pains from Mac to iPad were minimal, and the device has grown even more capable since that time thanks to improvements in iOS. My need for a Mac is now extremely rare.</p>
<p>My <em>desire</em> for a Mac, however, still exists in a few specific use cases. There are things the Mac has to offer that I wish my iPad could replicate.</p>
<p>Now that the modern iPad has many basics of computing covered, here are the things I think it needs to take iPad-as-PC to the next level.</p></blockquote>
<p>My favourite proposition:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if an app like Workflow could become more Hazel-like, triggering workflows automatically in the background based on pre-set rules?</p></blockquote>
<p>They&#8217;re great ideas, and I hope Apple adopt at least a few of them.</p>
