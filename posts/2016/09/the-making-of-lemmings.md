title: The Making of Lemmings

<p>Back in March this year, <a href="https://readonlymemory.vg/the-making-of-lemmings/">Rich Stanton wrote a piece</a> on the development of the classic game, Lemmings. How it came to be, and also what came after.</p>
<p>Somehow this ended up in my Pocket to-read collection, and I&#8217;ve only just got round to reading it. Lemmings was one of my favourite games when I was growing up, and I was so young when I was playing it, that I don&#8217;t even remember what platform I played it on!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a snippet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mike Dailly had seen tiny 5-pixel high sprites in games like , a popular Atari ST shooter where the player’s ship rescued little android slaves, and thought that somewhere between this and a 16×16 sprite would be a sweet spot – where the small size made the Walker look big by comparison, but the animations were still good enough to impart character. One lunchtime he made an image of little men being crushed by weights, and shot by a laser gun – everyone loved it, and Gary Timmons added a few more traps. While everyone was laughing, Russell Kay was the first to say ‘There’s a game in that!’</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in video games, then I highly recommend it, and if not, then you should probably still give it a try.</p>
