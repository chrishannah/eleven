<pre><code>    &lt;div class="kg-card-markdown"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_inside"&gt;Guilherme Rambo&lt;/a&gt; has done it again with yet another great Mac app, this time it's &lt;a href="https://github.com/insidegui/AppleEvents"&gt;AppleEvents&lt;/a&gt; and as you may of guessed, it lets you watch all of the past events, and also stream live events.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>He previously developed apps such as <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/PodcastMenu">PodcastMenu</a>, putting Overcast in your menu Bar, or even the unofficial <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/WWDC">WWDC app for Mac</a>, which let&#8217;s you watch, download, favourite, any of the WWDC talks!</p>
<p>Anyway, AppleEvents is the newest addition, and it&#8217;s such a simple app but it fits it&#8217;s purpose superbly. You can catch up with the old events, but my favourite part of it is that you can stream live events. Such as the announcement tomorrow!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got to do some work at the same time, or maybe you like to have Twitter and the live stream open, then luckily for you it has Picture-in-Picture! Which even works on El Capitan. Just press the green icon in the top-left corner (usually the fullscreen button).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll definitely be using this, and for the foreseeable future as well!</p>
<hr />
<p>Seeing as Guilherme is constantly releasing these open-source and free Mac apps for everyone, it’s only fair that he get’s compensated in some way!</p>
<p>So why don’t you check out his apps on the Mac App Store?</p>
