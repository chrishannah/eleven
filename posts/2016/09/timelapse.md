<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>A while ago, I was experimenting with my (very) old DSLR in my garden, paired with a pretty cool application &#8211; <a href="http://www.dslrassistant.com">DSLR Assistant</a>. I decided I wanted to check out time-lapses, especially trying to capture one at night.</p>
<p>Well, I was just on Vimeo, and I noticed that it was the only ever video I have uploaded!</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re interested in seeing how it turned out, then the video is below. The whole timespan of the images was about 75 minutes, and it was taken with a Canon EOS 1000D with a cheap 50mm prime lens.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;m starting to get very interested in videos, more specifically creating them. So you may see more small experimental creations from me soon.</p>
