<div class="kg-card-markdown"><!-- link[http://www.imore.com/iphone-7-and-iphone-7-plus-video-review?utm_source=radicalthinker.net] --></p>
<p>Rene Ritchie along with Serenity Caldwell, has put together a quick video review of the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Serenity Caldwell and I took a look at how we wanted to shoot our iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus review video, we new we couldn&#8217;t just spout the specs in a room or street set. We had to take to the streets. So, we took the iPhones 7 out and shot with the new wide angle and telephoto cameras, tested the new water resistance, abused the better battery efficiency, tried out the new Home button, and otherwise put them both through their paces and then some â€” on the streets of New York City!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t really ever get around to reading long reviews, so this video was perfect.</p>
