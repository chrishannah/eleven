title: Scrivener for iOS - Feature Overview
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>As you may already know, Scrivener, the great writing app for Mac/Windows, has now come to iOS!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard about Scrivener a lot before, and it seems to be the most popular app for novelists. Well as you would presume, it&#8217;s pretty feature packed. And I didn&#8217;t really know where to start when trying to learn about it. Now it&#8217;s on iOS, it seems like that&#8217;s version I would use myself.</p>
<p>Fortunately for all potential Scrivener users, the developers, Literature &amp; Latte, have released a 10 minute video which goes over all the features in the iOS app!</p>
