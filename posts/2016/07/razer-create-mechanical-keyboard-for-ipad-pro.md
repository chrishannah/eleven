title: Razer Create Mechanical Keyboard for iPad Pro
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>That&#8217;s not a headline that many would expect, but Razer have indeed <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-mechanical-keyboard-case-ipad-pro">created a mechanical keyboard</a> for the iPad Pro.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve made this keyboard, and packed it into a case which also features a metal kickstand, and a protective outer case for the actual iPad.</p>
<p>The kickstand isn&#8217;t fixed to any specific angle, like most other cases/stands, and can be adjusted to any preferred position. That&#8217;s a pretty big improvement on the rest.</p>
<p>They also developed &#8220;ultra-low-profile&#8221; mechanical switches for the keys, which <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/razer-mechanical-switches">you can read more about</a>. They say the force needed to recognise a key press is 70g, but I don&#8217;t really know what this means. I use a <a href="http://www.pckeyboard.com/page/product/UB4ZPHA">mechanical keyboard</a> sometimes, but I don&#8217;t see any huge difference between them and my MacBook.</p>
<p>It also allows you to type in dark environments, as it features backlighting! Which once you&#8217;ve tried, you can&#8217;t not have.</p>
<p>The battery life is <em>okay</em> if you use the backlighting constantly, which will give you approximately 10 hours on a single charge. But if you turn off the backlighting, it will last approximately 600 hours. So I guess it isn&#8217;t that bad, just don&#8217;t use the backlight too much.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gb-en/store/razer-mechanical-keyboard-case-ipad-pro">available in the store already</a> for a whopping Â£159.99, but it seems it&#8217;s currently being shipped from the US. So while you get free shipping, there will probably be a customs/tax charge with it.</p>
<p>Overall, I really like the design, and I much prefer typing on a mechanical keyboard to a glass screen. But not enough to spend that amount of money unfortunately.</p>
