title: Square Enix Brings Role-Playing Game to Apple Watch
---

<pre><code>&lt;div class="kg-card-markdown"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, it was announce that Square Enix (the creator of Final Fantasy) was releasing a role-playing game for the Apple Watch. It was all because of &lt;a href="http://www.jp.square-enix.com/cosmosrings/en/"&gt;the (rather ugly) website&lt;/a&gt; that was made, to promote the upcoming app, Cosmos Rings.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the website says about the story:</p>
<blockquote><p>A dark and timeless world.<br />
The Goddess is gone and time has stopped.<br />
Now it&#8217;s up to you to traverse the Rift an stand against those who would see it&#8217;s flow stilled forever. Regrettably, the path to saving the Goddess of Time is not an easy one.</p></blockquote>
<p>And about the Apple Watch experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>Retro pixel art and the Apple Watch&#8217;s cutting edge graphics come together to tell an unforgettable story.<br />
The power of time is in your hands.<br />
Simply use the Digital Crown to turn back the clock!<br />
Certain conditions may also earn you special messages.</p></blockquote>
<p>They also released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIC_fcZx2hI">promotional video</a> , which in my opinion doesn&#8217;t really show much about the game.</p>

<p>I think the graphics are very similar to the Final Fantasy games, which I didn’t really like either.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can buy <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/cosmos-rings/id1097448601?ign-mpt=uo%253D4&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=website&amp;mt=8">Cosmos Rings from the App Store</a> for £4.49/$5.99. I’ll be watching the game from a distance for a while, because that’s a lot of money for a game which I’m 90% sure isn’t for me.</p>
