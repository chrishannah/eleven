<p>Joe Caiati, <a href="http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-best-news-aggregation-service/">writing for The Sweet Setup</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>News has changed dramatically. Today, there are remnants of the way news used to work, but these traditional channels are slowly becoming a distant memory.</p>
<p>In an age past, the newspaper was delivered to your doorstep in the morning ready to be digested over a cup of coffee. When you returned home from work and settled down on the couch, the nightly news on TV caught you up on the day’s events.</p>
<p>While those outlets are still around today, news is much more complicated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He talks about what news is, and how we tend to consume news nowadays,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are innumerable online publications hurling stories everywhere. Some of them are pertinent to your interests, some of them waste your time, some of them are shared by friends, and then there is still the unknown that you may be missing out on.</p>
<p>To combat this news overload, a group of apps have tried to tackle this problem in hopes that they can bubble up the right stories so that you don’t have to work so hard to stay up-to-date on your interests and current events. We have tested many news digest services and found that Nuzzel is the best.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great read, and I&#8217;m a Nuzzel user myself. But even if you already use the app as well, Joe has written a very intriguing piece on news in general, and also more in depth into Nuzzel features you may not be aware of.</p>
