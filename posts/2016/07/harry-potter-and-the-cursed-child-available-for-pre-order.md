<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Since the first seven Harry Potter books, and the 8 films, we&#8217;ve all been dying to sink our teeth into something Potter. Thankfully there&#8217;s another film on the way, but there&#8217;s also this play &#8211; &#8220;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&#8221;.</p>
<p>The play will receive it&#8217;s world premiere in London&#8217;s West End on the 30th July, and the book, which is in fact a &#8220;Script Book&#8221; will be available digitally and physically in print the next day.</p>
<p>This release isn&#8217;t the final version, as the definitive version will be released later this year. However, this is the &#8220;Special Rehearsal Edition&#8221;, and will be whatever the play script it at the time of the play&#8217;s preview performances.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about the story, then here is a small description of what you can look forward to:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isnâ€™t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father of three school-age children.</p>
<p>While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes darkness comes from unexpected places.</p></blockquote>
