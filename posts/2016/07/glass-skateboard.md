<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what a glass skateboard would look/ride like, then check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwhGE0vd-w">this video by Braille Skateboarding</a>.</p>
<p>They also have some other videos, where people have sent in some interesting skateboards, so check them out as well!</p>
<p>I personally would love a skateboard that I can ride in any weather.</p>
