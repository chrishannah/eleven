<blockquote>
<p>Today I did two things I do nearly every day. 1) I bought something using a credit card, and 2) I complained about something on Twitter. But today, the complaint on Twitter was related to payments, and now my replies are blowing up. Theyâ€™re blowing up because I said a very obvious thing: in the past couple of months, buying something with a credit card in America has become an absolutely awful experience.</p>

<p>This is really stupid. The UK has had chip and pin payments for years, and the US is supposed to be more advanced?</p>
