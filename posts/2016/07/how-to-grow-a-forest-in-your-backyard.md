title: How to grow a forest in your backyard
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown"><!-- link[https://www.ted.com/talks/shubhendu_sharma_how_to_grow_a_forest_in_your_backyard] --></p>
<p>I watch TED videos a lot, but I thought <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/shubhendu_sharma_how_to_grow_a_forest_in_your_backyard">this one definitely had to be shared</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forests don&#8217;t have to be far-flung nature reserves, isolated from human life. Instead, we can grow them right where we are â€” even in cities. Eco-entrepreneur and TED Fellow Shubhendu Sharma grows ultra-dense, biodiverse mini-forests of native species in urban areas by engineering soil, microbes and biomass to kickstart natural growth processes. Follow along as he describes how to grow a 100-year-old forest in just 10 years, and learn how you can get in on this tiny jungle party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s just under 10 minutes, but I found it very fascinating, and it proves there are things we can do to kickstart nature.</p>
