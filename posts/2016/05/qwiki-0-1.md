<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>I&#8217;ve started working on a new app. It&#8217;s a Wikipedia search app for Mac, called <a href="https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/501e0d8f79ac4011a03d83791f7edb90/app_versions/3">Qwiki</a>. At the minute it lets you search for an article, and quickly access that page in your browser.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_7321-730x1024.png" alt="Qwiki Screenshot"></p>
<p>It&#8217;s only been in development for a few days, so it&#8217;s nowhere near the end product.</p>
<p>I plan on adding loads more features, such as copying the link (including Markdown style), and the standard share sheet. I think I will also add in an option to view the content of the article directly in the app, but I&#8217;ve got to work out how I want to do that.</p>
<p>But even though it&#8217;s super early days for Qwiki, I&#8217;ve made the beta open to the public, so that I can get as much feedback as possible.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;ve got a Mac and it runs OS X 10.10 or higher, then you can <a href="https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/501e0d8f79ac4011a03d83791f7edb90/app_versions/3">test out Qwiki</a>!</p>
<p>You can give feedback through Hockey, or direct to me on Twitter at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/chrishannah">@chrishannah</a>.</p>
