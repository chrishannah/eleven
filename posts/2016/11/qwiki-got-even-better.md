title: Qwiki Got Even Better!
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>My app <a href="http://getqwiki.co">Qwiki</a> received it&#8217;s second update the other day, and I&#8217;m really happy with the progress it&#8217;s making!</p>
<p>Here are the release notes for 1.2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the latest update there are things that make Qwiki a bit more of a polished product.</p>
<p>Including things like being able to set Qwiki to launch on startup (Which was a lot harder than expected), a slightly more &quot;lit&quot; icon (Brighter colours, bigger stroke, and a gradient), some extra accessibility support, and also some behind the scenes efficiency work (But we all know you don&#8217;t care about that).</p>
<p><strong>One More Thing</strong></p>
<p>Qwiki now supports every language Wikipedia does! Just select it in the Preferences window, and you&#8217;ll be reading articles in whatever language you select. I recommend trying out &quot;Scots&quot;, that&#8217;s pretty funny!</p>
<p>P.S. TouchBar support coming in the next update!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I said above, I&#8217;m working on adding some form of functionality for the TouchBar in the new MacBook Pro&#8217;s. Mine should arrive soon, so I can fully test that out and ship it to everyone! I also redesigned the website, which you <a href="http://getqwiki.co">can check out</a>.</p>
<p>For now, you can <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/qwiki-search-bar-article-viewer/id1115955666?at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=qwiki_article&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=12">buy Qwiki on the Mac App Store for Â£2.99</a>.</p>
