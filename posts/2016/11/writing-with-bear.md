<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Since Bear has been officially released for both <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1016366447?at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=website&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1091189122?at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=website&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=12">macOS</a> (also been selected for Editors choice!), I thought I’d share my thoughts on the app.</p>
<p>I’ve actually been using Bear for a while, ever since it entered beta. And it&#8217;s been a remarkable tool for me, whether it&#8217;s writing blog posts or even just jotting down small notes.</p>

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Bear actually differentiates from other apps quite a lot, but mainly in the way it looks. It has its own version of Markdown that it uses, but you can always change that to support the original Gruber version. Then you have the 9 really cool themes to choose from, and there&#8217;s more variety then other apps. I personally use Panic Mode.</p>
<p>As it’s available for both macOS and iOS, there are slight differences in the design, but these are just platform differences, not how the app functions.<br />
It’s split into three different views, the tags view which is on the left, the list of posts in the middle, and then the actual post on the right. On the Mac you can choose which views you want visible, and on iOS it appears differently based on what orientation/device you are on.</p>
<h2 id="editor">Editor</h2>
<p>The editor is clean, and it lets you focus on the content. It’s a style used by most of the modern apps, and I really love it. There’s an Information panel you can bring up, by just tapping the (i) button in the top right corner (iOS and macOS). It brings up some some handy information like read time, last editing device, and also gives you the option to export to different file types.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Fri-4-11-4-38pm-33.png" /></p>
<p>You can do the standard markdown formatting like bold, italics, underline, and strike through text. Of course it supports links, but it displays them slightly different with a link icon and the title. You don’t see the underlying Markdown code or URL, but with a tap/click on the link, you can change the<br />
title or url easily.</p>

<p>Another benefit over other apps is the ability to insert inline images in a post, which isn&#8217;t especially useful for me when I&#8217;m writing these types of posts that require screenshots.</p>
<p>There’s also support for embedding lines or blocks of code, and you can actually specify a language to get better formatting.</p>

<p>When you’re typing on iOS, a custom shortcut bar makes it even easier, with quick access to different formatting, links, photos, and code blocks.</p>

<h2 id="organisingnotes">Organising Notes</h2>
<p>The way you organise your notes in Bear is by adding tags, you can add these anywhere in a note. It allows you to see them clearly separated in the Tags view, or even search or them.</p>
<p>It’s a format I quite like, as it allows to be more flexible when writing. I for one lose track of notes when I have to place them in certain folders, so being able to just add a “RadThinker” tag, I can quickly find all the posts I’ve written for my blog.</p>
<p>Something else I don’t really see on other apps, is a trash folder. In Bear you can view any document you’ve deleted, and then restore it if you’ve done it by mistake.</p>
<h2 id="importexport">Import/Export</h2>
<p>Most people already use a note taking app, so you’ll want to move it all to Bear. Well you can import text files straight in to Bear, and it also features an import feature for Vesper users.</p>
<p>Exporting is even better, with the ability to export a note into .MD, .PDF, .HTML, .DOCX, .JPG, and .RTF. It also supports the standard share sheet, which is very useful.</p>
<p>What makes exporting even better, is when you combine it with an automation app like Workflow. For example you could export to Markdown (MD), and then share that to a workflow which posts it to your blog.</p>
<h2 id="prosubscription">Pro Subscription</h2>
<p>Bear is free to use on macOS and iOS, but there is a Pro subscription which will unlock loads of awesome features. Of course I signed up straight away.</p>
<p>With Pro you get access to things like syncing between your devices, access to all the themes, and exporting to every good file type.</p>
<p>You can choose to subscribe monthly, or yearly. With the prices being $1.49 per month, or $14.99 per year.</p>
<h2 id="finalthoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall I think Bear is <strong>great</strong>. It’s my note taking app, and also the app I use to write for this blog. Now I have syncing across macOS and iOS (Wasn’t available in beta), it’s even better.</p>
<p>The few things I think could improve Bear would be the ability to have some form of sub tags? to further organise notes, the option to have a link preview, and maybe even shared notes, but I know that’s a lot harder than it seems.</p>
<p>One big feature that I would <em>love</em> is <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a> integration, as that’s what RadicalThinker is run on. So being able to post directly from a text editor, would save uploading images, entering tags, and more importantly even opening my browser to access a (quite annoying) web interface.</p>
<p>I can see a bright future for Bear, and it’s started out with such a high standard, it can really become everyones default notes app <em>right now</em>. Of course there’s so much more Bear can do than I’ve written here, so the best place to find out more is <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/">on their website</a> , or by checking it out yourself.</p>
<p>Download Bear for <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1016366447?at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=website&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1091189122?at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=website&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=12">macOS</a> , and then make sure you support them by subscribing to Pro!</p>
