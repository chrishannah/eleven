title: My New "Wrathion"
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>My new MacBook Pro has arrived! So this is a sort of preliminary post, before my actual write up on what I think of it.</p>
<h2 id="spec">Spec</h2>
<p>For starters, this is the configuration of my new Mac:</p>
<ul>
<li>13&#8243; MacBook Pro with Touch Bar</li>
<li>3.1GHz Dual-core Intel Core i5</li>
<li>8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM</li>
<li>Intel Iris Graphics 550</li>
<li>256GB PCIe-based SSD</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="name">Name</h2>
<p>The name you may of guessed already, is &#8220;Wrathion&#8221;. I <a>started this</a> very recently, in which all of my devices are named after <a href="http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon">Dragons in WoW</a>. For a bit of back story, the Black Dragonflight were my favourite, until they became corrupted, until one little egg was rescued and is now the only uncorrupted Black Dragon. He is still a <a href="http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_whelp">whelp</a> (like my 13&#8243; Mac), and is Black (sort of like my Space Grey Mac), so it sort of fitted!</p>
<h2 id="stickers">Stickers</h2>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;ve already put stickers on my Mac. Eight to be exact. I do plan on covering it even more, but I didn&#8217;t want to rush into anything!</p>
<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s a <a href="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ezgif-com-crop.gif">little GIF I made</a> of my sticker situation:</p>

<h2 id="thoughtssofar">Thoughts So Far</h2>
<p>This MacBook is <strong>amazing</strong>, and actually a lot better than I thought. Also, something which may be unique, I love the new keyboard.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll get on using my Mac, and pretty soon I&#8217;ll be writing a better piece on what I think about it.</p>
