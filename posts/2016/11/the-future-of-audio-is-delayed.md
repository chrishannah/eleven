title: The Future of Audio is... Delayed?
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>We all know Apple want to push wireless as the new way to enjoy audio, and I&#8217;m a big fan of it too.</p>
<p>But according to MacRumors, their upcoming AirPods may even be delayed until January 2017:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following the confirmation that Apple has delayed its wireless &quot;AirPods&quot; beyond the original late October launch window, foreign supply chain sources are now pointing towards a launch date in January 2017, and not the late 2016 estimation that many believed would help the Bluetooth device sell during the holidays. &#8211; <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/01/airpods-launch-january-2017/">MacRumors</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is pretty rubbish news. In the ideal situation, I&#8217;m sure Apple would of loved to of released the AirPods along with the iPhone 7.</p>
