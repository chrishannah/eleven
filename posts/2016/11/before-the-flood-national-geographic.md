<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>National Geographic have just released a documentary called &quot;Before the Flood&quot;, in which Leonardo DiCaprio explores the world in regards to the effect of climate change, and what we can do to prevent even more harm to our planet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before the Flood, directed by Fisher Stevens, captures a three-year personal journey alongside Academy Award-winning actor and U.N. Messenger of Peace Leonardo DiCaprio as he interviews individuals from every facet of society in both developing and developed nations who provide unique, impassioned and pragmatic views on what must be done today and in the future to prevent catastrophic disruption of life on our planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s an incredible film, and while I was aware of most of climate change, it still opened my eyes up to a lot more harm we are doing. There&#8217;s also some people that are actively trying to turn it around, but they alone won&#8217;t be able to fix the planet, <em>everyone</em> needs to make themselves aware. Then the process of fixing things, won&#8217;t be as difficult.</p>
