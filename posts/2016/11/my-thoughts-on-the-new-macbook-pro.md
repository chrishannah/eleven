title: My Thoughts on the new MacBook Pro
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>I&#8217;ve been using my new MacBook Pro for a while now, so I thought I&#8217;d share my thoughts on it! I probably haven&#8217;t written about everything that&#8217;s new, but I&#8217;ve split everything up in to the main categories that I think everyone will care about.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>The physical design has changed a bit since the previous MacBook Pro, with it&#8217;s much smaller profile, and smaller bezel around the screen. And of course because it&#8217;s so light, it&#8217;s much more portable. Sure my old MacBook Pro wasn&#8217;t that heavy, and I could still carry it everywhere. But this is so much better at it. It&#8217;s so easy to just whip it out of my bag when I&#8217;m on the train into university.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a fan of dark colours, so I definitely had to get the Space Grey version. It&#8217;s <em>so</em> much better than the boring silver.</p>
<h2 id="display">Display</h2>
<p>The display on this MacBook is absolutely unbelievable, and I&#8217;m still finding it hard to fathom the fact it is this good. Maybe it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s my first Retina Mac, but then there&#8217;s also the Wide Colour support. I&#8217;ve had a look at some different images on this new Mac and my old one, and the colours are just so vibrant.</p>
<h2 id="speakers">Speakers</h2>
<p>Not a feature I thought I would be writing about, but these speakers are a true improvement to the previous laptops. They&#8217;re so loud that I probably couldn&#8217;t ever have them at full volume when at my Mac, but maybe when you have a few friends round, this could be the sound system. It&#8217;s that good.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also surprisingly clear, and the sound quality is a lot better. The fact that the speakers have moved to either side of the keyboard is a big bonus as well, because everything just sounds more <em>real</em>. I can&#8217;t really describe this, but it&#8217;s just so much better.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h2>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t see what all the fuss is all about, I <em>really</em> like this keyboard. It feels a lot more stable than the older design, and if I think about it, I can tell that the keys don&#8217;t travel as far. But they have some travel in them, and they make a pretty good clacking sound as I&#8217;m typing. I didn&#8217;t have a transition period to get used to it, I was able to type straight away.</p>
<h2 id="ports">Ports</h2>
<p>This is one of the things that gained a lot of attention, and I completely see why. My MacBook has 5 ports, 4 Thunderbolt 3/USB C, and a headphone port. I understand dongles aren&#8217;t brilliant, and they cost even more money. But I believe USB C is the future of wired connectivity, and therefore devices will slowly move over to this standard.</p>
<p>My issue is with the fact that it doesn&#8217;t connect to my iPhone 7. Okay, the iPhone came out before the Mac, and not all iPhone users have a new Mac they can plug their iPhone into. But I would argue that hardly anyone even plugs their phone into their laptop anymore, so including a USB C -&gt; Lightning cable in the box would of been so much better.</p>
<p>Then there is the headphone port, if Lightning is the future of audio, then why isn&#8217;t it on here? And more importantly, why can&#8217;t I use my EarPods with my laptop? Usually I would only ever use one pair of earphones (my current iPhones EarPods), on all of my devices. But now if I want to take my Mac somewhere and listen to music, I&#8217;ll have to either take two pairs of EarPods (3.5mm Jack and Lightning), or just use the old ones and carry a Lightning -&gt; 3.5mm Jack adapter. Neither solution is any good.</p>
<p>However, while I say all of this stuff, the only thing I&#8217;ve plugged into my Mac has been my external display. And because my HDMI cable is always plugged into my screen, attaching an adapter to it is completely fine.</p>
<h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>
<p>I have the 13&#8243; version of the MacBook Pro, and with just the integrated Intel Iris 550 graphics, it&#8217;s not a computer that&#8217;s hugely designed for gaming. But I&#8217;ve found that it was perfect for my needs.</p>
<p>I am a gamer, but not one that plays all the newest games, or even many games. The few I play are World of Warcraft, Minecraft, and a few smaller ones (the recent one being TouchGrind).</p>
<p>For World of Warcraft, I had to play it on the absolute lowest graphics on my previous Mac. It was find for me, because I still loved playing the game, but it wasn&#8217;t the best experience I could have. On this Mac however, I put this straight up to the mid level settings to test it out, and it worked! I was getting about 60 fps in very populated areas of the game. It&#8217;s <em>a lot better</em> than I expected it to be, and with the new display, the environments are really beautiful.</p>

<p>Then there is Minecraft, it&#8217;s not a hugely demanding game, but it&#8217;s not the small pixel game that everyone may think it is. I have it with every video setting turned up to the max (Except view distance, because that can get stupid), and it&#8217;s completely fine! It&#8217;s the perfect Minecraft experience, and while that isn&#8217;t much, it&#8217;s great to know my laptop can support it. And also whilst doing a lot of other things at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="touchbar">Touch Bar</h2>
<p>I do like the Touch Bar, however I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s groundbreaking new technology. But maybe it doesn&#8217;t have to be. It&#8217;s made a few things for me much faster, especially the Emoji picker!</p>
<p>The design of the Touch Bar is better than I imagined, as it blends into the physical keys on the keyboard really well. I&#8217;ve had it in a wide range of lighting conditions, and it&#8217;s always just felt natural.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly not just bringing iOS to the Mac in regards to adding a touch screen, I think it&#8217;s a true extension to the keyboard.</p>
<h2 id="overallthoughts">Overall Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, I love this new MacBook Pro. It&#8217;s the perfect laptop for me, and probably even more.</p>
<p>The design is a great improvement, and the only flaws I see at the minute is the lack of ports, but this will improve over time as more of my devices become USB C.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had three MacBooks before this one, and my previous one lasted me 5 years. So I expect this one to last me probably the same amount of time.</p>
<p>It is a bit expensive, and more so for myself because of the Brexit price increase, but I think it&#8217;s totally worth it.</p>
