<p>We want to provide you a detailed look at a new feature coming soon to Pokémon GO &#8211; Daily bonuses! Trainers will soon be able to receive a bonus for certain daily activities, including catching a Pokémon or visiting a PokéStop once a day. You’ll earn a larger bonus if you do this seven days in a row! &#8211; <a href="http://pokemongolive.com/en/post/daily-bonus/">Pokémon GO Blog</a></p>

<p>This seems like a nice idea for continuing players, but most people have stopped playing now. So is this there idea to try and attract people back to the game?</p>
<p><a href="http://pokemongolive.com/en/post/daily-bonus/">Read the blog post</a> for the exact details on the bonuses.</p>
