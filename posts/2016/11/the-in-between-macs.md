<p>Stephen Hackett begins his monthly column on MacStories, with a really interesting article about <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/the-in-between-macs/">where the been MacBook Pro fits in</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The current MacBook Pro line is a little bit of a mess. Even after brushing aside the last-generation machines that are still for sale, the current offerings are confusing. Both 15-inch models come with the Touch Bar, but only two of the three 13-inch models offered do.</p>
<p>That $1,499 non-Touch-Bar-but-still-in-the-new-skinny-case 13-inch MacBook Pro is what I&#8217;m typing on right now. It&#8217;s a great little laptop. The screen is gorgeous, battery life is great and it&#8217;s more than fast enough for what I need when I&#8217;m not in front of my 5K iMac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can clearly see Stephen has left his mark already, by quoting a piece from 2006.</p>
