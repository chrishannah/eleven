<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/notebooks-for-ios-and-mac-organizes-your-research-and-reference-materials/">John Voorhees reviewed Notebooks for iOS on MacStories</a>, and I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>From about a week of testing it out, I can see it becoming a very helpful and fundamental app to how I study, research, and organise my third year at university. I will be doing a major project, along with some smaller modules, so the flexibility, document structure, and organisation will suit this well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s way different to any other text editors, and I probably wont directly do my typing in Notebooks, but it will used for more collating. If you deal with any type of project, then I would suggest giving it a quick look.</p>
<p>I have only downloaded this on my iPad so far, but I&#8217;ll probably end up getting it on my Mac as well soon.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/notebooks-for-ios-and-mac-organizes-your-research-and-reference-materials/">read John&#8217;s full review on MacStories</a>, and <a href="http://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/id780438662?at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=website&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8">download Notebooks from the App Store</a>.</p>
