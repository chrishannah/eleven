<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>In a few hours I&#8217;ll be on a plane towards Greece, so I thought I&#8217;d write something here before I left.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be in Crete for two weeks, and hopefully I don&#8217;t come back too sunburned! (My skin doesn&#8217;t appreciate UV radiation as much as others)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not taking my DSLR camera, because my iPhone 5S hasn&#8217;t disappointed me yet with the camera quality, so I&#8217;ll be taking a few with that. I&#8217;ll be posting these to my Instagram, most likely to my Story, because otherwise I may clog up peoples feeds.</p>
<p>So if you want to check out Crete from the eyes of my 5S, then I would suggest you <a href="http://instagram.com/lordchrishannah">follow me on Instagram</a>, I&#8217;m @lordchrishannah. (Yes, I am actually a Lord. I own a square foot of land in Scotland ðŸ¤“)</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t have too much internet while I&#8217;m over there, but I think the Hotel should have decent enough WiFi for me to catch up in the evenings. So I&#8217;ll still be contactable, but preferably on <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah">Twitter at @chrishannah</a>.</p>
<p><em>(Also, it&#8217;s pretty cool that I can now write random person posts on this blog, it&#8217;s one of the main reasons I merged my old one and App Recap!)</em></p>
