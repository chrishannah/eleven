title: The Lack of a Headphone Port and Potential AirPods
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>There&#8217;s been constant rumours and opinions, but it seems pretty clear now that the next iPhone will be lacking a 3.5mm headphone port.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to ramble on about whether I think it&#8217;s a good idea or not, because the decision to remove it has already been made, so there nothing anyone can do to bring it back.</p>
<p>My question is that, will Apple provide a pair of Lightning EarPods, or even a pair of wireless EarPods<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>? And also, which one will be included in the box of every new iPhone?</p>
<p>I can see it being the wired version included in the box, but I will definitely be purchasing the wireless pair if they are available. That&#8217;s if they&#8217;re reasonably priced. I won&#8217;t be spending any more than £50 on a pair.</p>
<p>Once you get a pair of wireless earphones, the power becomes another issue, and they will obviously need internal batteries. So how will they be charged? I&#8217;m hoping they will be individual buds, so there&#8217;s then two extra batteries to charge.</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t want <em>another</em> charging cable, because that means keeping my iPhone, iPad, Watch, and potential AirPods charged up, will be a nightmare!</p>
<p>I think that they should be charged the same way that an Apple Pencil is, via a male Lightning pin, which can then connect to your iOS device to charge. In my opinion this will need the 80/20 quick charge method that the Watch has, to make sure you can quickly get a decent charge, and get back to listening. Because you don&#8217;t want a situation where your away from a power source, your earphones go flat, and you have no way to listen to anything!</p>
<p>A small idea I had was if the earpieces themselves would have a kind of dock/case, like the case the current EarPods come in, and then they would both be charged simultaneously by an internal battery in the case. Which then could be charged by a lightning cable like your iPhone/iPad. This would be a middleman battery, but more bearable than having to charge two buds separately, or having to wait until you get home to charge them.</p>
<p>Anyway, we will all see what happens at Apple&#8217;s September event.</p>
