<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>It has just been announced that Castro, a podcast app for iOS will receive a very hefty overhaul in the form of <a href="http://supertop.co/castro/">Castro 2</a>.</p>
<p>With the official launch being on the 15th August (my birthday), they have <a href="http://supertop.co/castro/#moneyshot">released a trailer video</a> which shows how Castro 2 will work.</p>
<p><video controls="controls" width="300" height="400"><source src="http://cdn.supertop.co/castro/assets/v2.mp4" type="video/mp4" />Your browser does not support HTML5 video.</video></p>
<p>When I first heard about another podcast app coming, I was initially hesitant to even check it out, because how good Overcast has been to me.</p>
<p>But after watching the video myself, and also checking out the more in-depth article they have on their blog <a href="http://blog.supertop.co/post/148714915027/tentacles">&#8220;Castro 2.0: The Servers&#8221;</a>, I&#8217;m really impressed with the work that has gone into Castro. It also doesn&#8217;t just copy the standard conventions of listening to podcasts, especially with the idea of having a general inbox for new episodes, and then a queue for ones you want to listen to.</p>
<p>Even Marco Arment, the creator of Overcast praised Castro:</p>
<blockquote><p>Competition is matching a feature checklist. Innovation is defining the roadmap. @supertopsquid, true innovators: <a href="http://supertop.co/castro/#trailer">http://supertop.co/castro/#trailer</a> &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/763862259655409664">Twitter &#8211; @marcoarment</a></p></blockquote>
<p>If it was just <em>another podcast app</em>, I probably wouldn&#8217;t care too much about it, but I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to playing with Castro.</p>
<p>It could well become my next favourite podcast app.</p>
