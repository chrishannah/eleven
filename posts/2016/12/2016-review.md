title: My 2016
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>A lot of people write long year in review blog posts, so I also decided to do one as well. But it was also beneficial for myself, as it seems I did a lot more this year than I thought I did!</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<h3 id="qwiki">Qwiki</h3>
<p>Qwiki is an app for macOS, that let‚Äôs you search directly and view Wikipedia articles, directly in your menu bar. It also has sharing and export options, but that‚Äôs basically what it is.</p>
<p>Now in version 1.3, the app has come a long way. And it is my first <em>proper</em> app, meaning I spent longer in development, I had a beta testing stage, and then I actually marketed the app. I learned a lot from this project, and it‚Äôs my best app to date.</p>

<h3 id="chrishannahme"><a href="https://chrishannah.me/">ChrisHannah.me</a></h3>
<p>I think I may of owned this domain before 2016, but this was the year it finally got sorted out.</p>
<p>This website serves as my ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù page on the internet, a place where you can find general information, my past work, and also how to contact me.</p>
<p>I initially <a href="http://radicalthinker.net/diversity-in-tech-chris-column-issue-1/">wrote about it in September</a>, but it has been radically changed since then.</p>
<p><a href="https://chrishannah.me/">Website</a></p>
<h3 id="pixelsstickerpack">Pixels Sticker Pack</h3>
<p>When iOS 10 (X) came out, I knew I had to create an iMessage Sticker Pack myself. So I put my pixel art skills to the test, and created Pixels Sticker Pack!</p>
<p><a href="http://radicalthinker.net/pixels-sticker-pack/">Blog Post</a><br />
<a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixels-sticker-pack/id1155175303?uo=4&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=myself&amp;mt=8">App Store</a></p>
<h3 id="chuploads">CH Uploads</h3>
<p>Another small project came later in the year, and it was the result of being bored in my university classes. This time it was a basic image/video upload manager, that was built with PHP and MySQL.</p>

<h3 id="tapgap">Tap Gap</h3>
<p>Again, I got bored at university. But this time I made a little game! More specifically an iPhone game, where you need to tap the screen when the line is inside the gap.</p>
<p><a href="http://radicalthinker.net/tapgap-fast-paced-accuracy-game/">Blog Post</a><br />
<a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/tap-gap-fast-paced-accuracy/id1177402031?at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=myself&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8">App Store</a></p>
<h2 id="devices">Devices</h2>
<p>Two of my main devices received a pretty big update this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 7 Plus</li>
<li>MacBook Pro (Touch Bar!) &#8211; <a href="http://radicalthinker.net/my-new-wrathion/">Initial Blog Post</a> / <a href="http://radicalthinker.net/my-thoughts-on-the-new-macbook-pro/">My Review</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>I write a lot on <a href="http://radicalthinker.net">my blog</a>, but this year I got a few opportunities (Although very similar üòâ) to write on other peoples blogs:</p>
<ul>
<li>MacSparky &#8211; <a title="HOME SCREENS ‚Äì CHRISTOPHER HANNAH" href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2016/7/home-screens-christopher-hannah">HOME SCREENS ‚Äì CHRISTOPHER HANNAH</a></li>
<li>MacStories Weekly &#8211; <a title="MacStories Weekly - My Home Screen" href="http://radicalthinker.net/macstories-weekly-my-home-screen-2/">My Home Screen</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also started a weekly newsletter, which was fun when it started. But after a few weeks, I couldn‚Äôt think of anything interesting to write. So this was unfortunately stopped. Here is the <a href="http://radicalthinker.net/diversity-in-tech-chris-column-issue-1/">first issue that went out</a>, which I‚Äôm still pretty pleased with.</p>
<p>I also wrote about <a href="http://radicalthinker.net/hello-again/">Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúHello Again‚Äù event</a>, where they announced the pretty nifty MacBook Pro that I‚Äôm currently writing this post on. It was a while since I did a post like this, since covering loads of Apple events when I wrote AppRecap.</p>
<h2 id="travelling">Travelling</h2>
<p>Although I started the year just coming <a href="http://radicalthinker.net/keeping-up-with-chris-1-italy-bound/">back from Italy</a>, I didn‚Äôt actually do much travelling in 2016.</p>
<p>However in the summer I did take a <a href="http://radicalthinker.net/crete/">two-week trip to Crete!</a></p>
<h2 id="youtube">YouTube</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve had a YouTube Channel for a long time, but this year I eventually started watching loads more videos. And this got me even to create a few myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llFnqbMt7Ts">Typing Noises &#8211; MacBook Pro 2011 vs Wireless Keyboard vs MacBook Pro 2016</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3T3UAVeGmM">A Few Seconds With Touch Bar Piano</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SW4GHWbhQA">Touch Bar Apps</a></li>
</ul>
