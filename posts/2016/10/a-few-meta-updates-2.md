title: A Few Meta Updates
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>A few things happened recently, so I thought I&#8217;d put a small update here.</p>
<p><strong>What I&#8217;m Doing Now</strong></p>
<p>After seeing <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/now/">Matt Gemmel&#8217;s</a> Now page, and reading more about the <a href="https://sivers.org/nowff">/now page movement</a>, I created <a href="http://radicalthinker.net/now">one of my own</a>.</p>
<p>I will update this regularly with what I&#8217;m currently doing, so that I don&#8217;t need to repeat myself, or even forget anything!</p>
<p><strong>Stickers</strong></p>

I ordered a test batch of stickers from Sticker Mule a while ago, and they just arrived. I think they look pretty good!</p>
<p>Hopefully in the future I can give them out, sell them, or just stick them everywhere myself?</p>
<p><strong>T-Shirts</strong></p>

Something else I&#8217;ve always wanted to do for my blog, create a logo tee. My problem with things like TeeSpring and Cotton Bureau, is that they don&#8217;t ship until a set amount has been ordered.</p>
<p>Luckily I found TeeMill, who will let you purchase designs straight away!</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve made a basic white tee with the Radical Thinker logo, that is <a href="https://radicalthinker.teemill.co.uk/category/basic-logo-2214/">available now!</a></p>
