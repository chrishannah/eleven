<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jmdenisme">Jean-Mark Denis</a> has just released a set of <a href="http://jmd.im/black.html?ref=radicalthinker.net">super high quality wallpapers</a> for your mobile and desktop. They are beautifully minimal and black.</p>
<p>As he puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>A wallpaper series using shapes and lights.<br />
High resolution rendered using Cinema 4D, for your phone and desktop.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are six designs, with two of them coming soon. The one you see above this post is #1, and I currently have #2 set as my wallpaper on my mac.</p>
<p>Who would of thought such simplicity could look so good?</p>
