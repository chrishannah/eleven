After a week in Lanzarote, I'm back in the UK.

It was definitely good to get away for a bit. Especially as it's a busy time at work at the moment, so a little break was needed.

But that does mean it's now straight back to the grind. Getting home at 04:30 this morning and starting work at 08:30 wasn't the greatest feeling ever.

While I was away I took two laptops (like most people do I assume), one ThinkPad X1 Carbon with a fresh Arch/Hyprland install, and my 14" M1 MacBook Pro. I mentioned this in [the last weeknote](https://chrishannah.me/weeknote/1708/), and it continued for a few days, but in the end I got tired of the barebones feel and went back to my Mac.

At least for now, I think I'm more suited to the Mac. Especially when I don't have much time between working and having a baby to look after.

There was one fun project I worked on every now and then while I was away. I was working on a website design, which had sort of an old retro technology feel with analogue buttons. It's not perfect, and it doesn't fit what I have in mind just yet. But I guess I may as well show a quick preview of the header design, which is a title, two different menu designs, and a random power LED.

As for entertainment, because of the flights to/from Lanzarote, I was afforded the time to watch some "TV" for a change. Which, unsurprisingly, means I just binged a load more Yellowstone. I watched four episodes on the flight back to London, and it puts me halfway through the fourth season. I reckon I could be done by the end of this week if I use my commute time wisely.

Speaking of a commute, that will be changing soon. After over eight years of working at my current job, travelling back and forward from my town into the exact same office, we're finally moving.

The commute time doesn't change much, but I'll now be working near the Tower of London, which is a nice area, and should be a very welcome change of scenery.

We'll start packing up over the next few weeks, and then at the end of May, we're out! Then, after around two weeks working from home, our new office will be ready, and I'll hopefully have a desk with a good view.
