Some more laptop updates this week:

**Work**

My new M4 Pro 16" MacBook Pro has been ordered, so once that has arrived, I will officialy purchase my current work laptop. The current price is around Â£425, which isn't bad, but there's also a change it will decrease as time goes on.

**Personal**

My goal of finding a new personal machine is still all over the place. I was talking to my brother about pricing up my new Mac (he gets a discount through work), and then I got cold feet again. That was also helped by [Pewdiepie's unexpected video about his Arch installation][pdp]. That's now on hold for a bit while I make a decision. but for now I'll start using my ThinkPad again, as it's running Ubuntu, so I cna get another feel for Linux, and decide if it's something I want to run long-term.

***

Speaking of my work laptop, I've created a new *living* document here on my blog, which I will use to [detail my entire configuration of my work Mac][ld]. It's obviously for my own benefit, but I guess it doesn't hurt having it on my site.

Maybe I'll do the same for my personal laptop, whatever that will be.

***

As for a final thought, as I was looking at my 9-month old daughter recently, and it still amazed me that I (and my partner) *created* her. So I wondered whether that feeling ever goes away. I hope not.
