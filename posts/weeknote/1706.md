## Making Bread

I had the idea recently that I wanted to see if I could bake bread from scratch. Nothing too elaborate or requiring any special equipment or techniques. But my goal is to be able to quickly throw together the typical ingredients (flour, water, salt, yeast) in the right ratio, cook in my airfryer, and then have decent bread rolls.

I'm using no real recipes, apart from a quick ratio I found on my first google search. I've since tried 4 times, with varying cooking times, temperatures, and also liquids (Stella Artois has worked the best so far).

So far they've not been perfect. Edible, but not perfect. If I ever make a really good one, I'll share a photo.

## PokeGuessr

I wanted to do some programming, and thought I could make a fun little game. So I made a guessing game in Node.JS where you can try and guess all 151 original Pokémon.

## Chocolate

Like most people, I've just taken part in the yearly exchange of overpriced chocolate. Which means I now have enough chocolate to last me for quite some time.

## Laptops

My work laptop has reached it's ripe age of 3 years, which means I'm able to purchase my laptop at a discounted price of £427. Obviously I don't *have* to buy my laptop, but it's a good way to get a cheap laptop and to also force a replacement.

A good condition 16" MacBook Pro (M1 Pro) with 500GB storage and 16GB memory for £427 seems a good price to me, so I'll be starting the purchase process shortly. I expected I'll just resell with the same price to someone in my family.

I wrote a short post the other day about [my ideal work laptop](https://chrishannah.me/my-ideal-world-laptop/).

Needless to say, I want my next work machine to be very intentionally built and customised. I want to build the most efficient machine for my work.

As for my personal laptop, I *still* haven't ordered my new Mac. Which, like [I said on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@chrishannah/114366329759213910), increases the likeliness of me ending up with a Framework machine instead.

## Minecraft

This may become a trend. Here's an updated view of my current humble base in Minecraft.

I have decided that in this world, I won't build any elaborate strucutres or designs that much, instead it will just be practical buildings that *may* also look nice.
