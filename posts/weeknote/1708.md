I'm writing this weeknote in a different location for a change. Right now, I'm
on holiday in Lanzarote. 

While I'm here, along with relaxing and spending some time with my family, I've
also taken along my trusty ThinkPad[^1]. Naturally, this means I've been
tinkering with a fresh Arch install, and configuring things like [Hyprland][hpr],
and [waybar][wb].

It's a fun experiment, but it will also help me determine if I can both make
Arch look and work well for me, and the same time ensuring it is something I can
use full-time.

Still on the topic of laptops, I got my new work machine last week. A 16"
MacBook Pro with a M4 Pro chip, 500 GB storage, and 24 GB memory. I've been
setting up as per my recent guide, and also discovering things I missed off. I
can't comment on the performance as I think I've only barely scratched the
surface so far. However, I do feel like the keyboard has been improved since the
M1 model?

Anyway, I'll keep it short this week. I've got a sunburn to catch.
