It's been a bit of a busy week at work. We're at the stage in our project where we're finalising our own functionality while also doing integration testing with a bunch of other teams and domains. A very tricky time.

***

Aside from work, I've been trying to get out in the garden a bit more. I've cut the lawn, overseeded where there were gaps, and tidied up some of the plants to make it look a bit more presentable. There's still more to do, but I think 30 minutes here and there will be enough.

Alongside me in the garden are some tadpoles...

My girlfriend got hold of them from someone elses pond recently, so we decided to put them in a little pond I made a while back. It's a half of a whiskey barrel, that I originally used as a plant pot, until I realised it was watertight as the plants were getting waterlogged constantly.

A few rocks, plants, solar-powered fountain later, we had a half-decent miniature pond.

I also bought five snails from eBay last year, and they've done fantastically this year. There must be hundreds of them in there now. I thought they would have started eating the plants, but the plants are still growing well and the water is always clear.

Right now, the snails are cohabiting well with the tadpoles, which have just recently started to grow legs!

I'm very much looking forward to my frog army this summer.
