## My search for a new laptop bag is back on...

Last week I was pretty set on getting a new small laptop backpack for work, seeing as my plan was to downsize to a 14" MacBook in the near future.

However, after talking to our IT department last week, I was told that we have 2 models to choose from. The base model 14" M4 MacBook Pro with 16 GB memory, or the base model 16" M4 Pro MacBook Pro with 24 GB of memory. Needless to say I settled with the 16" model, as it will have to last me a few years.

It will be a bit harder to find a backpack that holds this laptop, but at the same time is as small as possible. Most of the options that fit a 16" laptop seem to built around fitting your entire life in a single bag.

## Some changes at work

It's an interesting time at work, since I've now got a new manager. There was an internal rotation of managers between 2 teams, and now we need to go through the various phases of handovers between managers, planning for the future, and also the short-term changes that both managers will want to implement. I'm sure my new manager will want to put her stamp on how we do things, and I eagerly await what it will be.

## Yellowstone

Yep, I'm still watching Yellowstone. I completed season 2 last week, and I'm already stuck into season 3!

And I've only just discovered two prequel series, [1883](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13991232/), and [1923](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18335752/) which I will queuing up once I've completed Yellowstone.

## Minecraft not so forever

So I've been playing this Minecraft world for a while, but I got to a point where I had some resources collected, some basic farms, an *okay* base. But I died just a few too many times. So I decided to make *another* forever world, and start again from scratch.
