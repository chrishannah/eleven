I've been pondering a switch to Android for a while now, and I've been especially tempted by various Nothing phone models. However, I have come to the realisation that I will likely be again purchasing the next iPhone.

There's many small reasons, but I think for this year I just want stability. I'm a recent father, and I don't have time to faff around with my devices as much anymore. It's also partly down to my partner also having an iPhone, so everything is just a bit easier if we're on the same ecosystem.

I haven't been keeping up to date with rumours, so I don't know exactly what model I'll be choosing. But I'm 90% sure I'll be going back to the "normal" size. There's a chance that I'll go to the base 16 model, as there could be a nice colour that tempts me. But I'm sure there will be some kind of camera appeal that keeps me on the Pro lineup.

Maybe I'll switch to Android in the future. But for now, I don't want to think about technology. For at least another year, I want it to just work.
