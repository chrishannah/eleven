title: Maybe Iâ€™m Not a Pro Anymore
---

[Brendon Bigly, writing for MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/stories/maybe-im-not-a-pro-anymore/):

> Apple just wrapped up their September event revealing a bunch of updates to the Apple Watch, AirPods, and iPhone lineups, and I have only one major takeaway as a person who was absolutely, positively going to get the iPhone 16 Pro if it came in gold: I am seriously considering downgrading to the non-Pro iPhone 16 this time around. 

A rather interesting take on what *Pro* means for the iPhone 16. I'm also having similar thoughts about whether I actually need the Pro model or not. My current device is the 15 Pro Max, and while I have my head set on moving back to the normal-sized iPhone, I am torn between 16 or 16 Pro.

I can live without the camera differences. But I don't know if I can live without ProMotion. Primarily because I didn't instantly notice the difference when I first got a device that supported it, so will I notice it when it's gone?
