title: The Making of Theme Hospital
---

I watched [a short documentary about the game Theme Hospital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCSZN06XiCY) last night, and to be honest, it was pretty fascinating. I don't want to spoil it, but it's fair to say it was much more popular than expected. I remember playing this for hours on end when I was younger.
