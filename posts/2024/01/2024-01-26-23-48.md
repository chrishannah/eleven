I can't believe it took this long, but as of tonight I've finally started
watching The Walking Dead. I don't know what I was doing in 2010 when it first
started, but somehow I let it completely pass me by.

I'm just about to start the fourth episode, and I'm already hooked. üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

There's a total of 177 episodes, which seems a lot, but at this rate I'll
be getting through them pretty quickly.
