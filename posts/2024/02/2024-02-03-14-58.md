I just checked out The Iconfactory's Kickstarter for their [Project Tapestry][pt] project, which in their words will be a "a universal, chronological timeline for iOS for any data thatâ€™s publicly available on the Internet".

It's a nice idea. And reminds me of BlackBerry Hub on my old BlackBerry, which
used to combine things like Twitter and Facebook, along with your emails, BBM
notifications, etc.

As for myself, I don't plan on backing the project. The only "feeds" that I
currently use are Mastodon (via Ivory), RSS feeds for various blogs, and Twitter/X
for football updates. And none of those really need to be combined together.

That's not to say it's not for you, so if you're interested, check out the
[Kickstarter][pt].
