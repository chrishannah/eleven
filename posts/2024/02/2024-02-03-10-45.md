Seeing as I've just recently switched to Firefox, I think it only makes sense that I try out Pocket at the same time. It's already built into Firefox, and when I've used Pocket in the
 past I've been impressed by it's suggestions. However, I haven't tried it in a long time, so it
 will be interesting to see how it compares to something like Readwise.
