It's been just shy of 2 weeks since I [started watching The Walking Dead][p][^1],
and I've just finished off the third season. Which puts me around 20% of the way
through all 11 seasons (177 episodes).

I've definitely missed out having only just started the show recently, but at least I'm
now able to binge it non-stop. I'm watching it at night, in my lunch break, on
my commutes, I literally fill any free time with it right now.

One thing's for sure, the next time a show like this comes out, I'm not
waiting over 13 years to give it a try.

[^1]: It's a bit funny that my last post was me getting excited about starting the fourth episode, and right now I'm about to start the fourth series.
