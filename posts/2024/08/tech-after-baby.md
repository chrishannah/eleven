If you didn't already know, little over a month ago I became a father for the first time.

It's incredible. And it's forever changed my life in more ways than I could ever have imagined. Especially regarding technology.

I was starting to think that I wasn't actually interested in any of it anymore. Because I started to just not have the urge to do anything, no reading blogs, no writing anything, no programming, nothing.

It was weird, since I don't feel that having a child has added *that* much stress to my life, and it's not like I'm so busy i have absolutely no free time anymore.

After some thinking, I realised that it's not that I'm not interesting it doing any of those things. I *want* to write on my blog, I *want* to keep up with other blogs, and I *definitely want* to keep programming in my spare time. Among a whole bunch of things I used to do day-to-day on my devices.

The problem is that I now need to optimise the technology I use, and the choices that I make, around a new reality. I don't have *no* time to do anything, I just have a little less time than before, which makes some tasks more cumbersome.

It adds a new level of friction that I wasn't used to before.

The biggest example is my phone. I currently use an iPhone 15 Pro Max. It's a great phone for watching videos, playing games, and for scrolling through social media. But if you've got a baby in one arm, it's near impossible to anything else one-handed.

The same also applies to my iPad to a lesser extent. I have the 12.9" iPad, so that's also not a one-hand device.

And as for my "real" computers, in my MacBook and gaming PC, these don't just require two hands. They require *time*. I'm not spending 60 seconds on my Mac writing a post for social media, I'm working on a project, going through my emails, writing a blog post, playing World of Warcraft, etc.

What I'm thinking now, is that instead of just letting my hobbies and digital life fade away, I should just adapt to my new situation.

The two device changes I think I will make in the close future will be to buy a smaller phone that I can use one-handed and do all the usual phone-stuff with. And also to buy a smaller iPad. I don't know if that means iPad Mini or the "normal" iPad. But if I'm already feeling friction with the big iPad, the desire for an "in-between" device will certainly grow. Especially as there will no doubt be things that I enjoy doing on a big phone that I won't be able to do anymore.

As for more decision changes, I'm sure a lot of it will be down to adapting my habits, but I think I also need to be more purposeful of the time I spend on my computers.

In a weird way, I think it will fun optimising my for new life.
