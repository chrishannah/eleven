title: Some Recent Bash Scripting Fun
---

I've been writing more and more bash scripts recently ([GitHub repo][gh]). It started when I was
playing around with a script called tmux-sessionizer from The Primeagen, that
uses [fzf][f] to search for directories in a preset location, and then open the
selected directory in a tmux session. 

The first three I came up with were all mainly some sort of selector-style tools
powered by fzf:

*(they may seem like odd names, but I wanted to be able to use these scripts
really quickly)*

- **tg** (right-top)- a customed version of tmux-sessionizer that lets you quickly fuzzy find a directory and then attach/reattach to a tmux session with it.
- **ala** (left)- fuzzy finder for alacritty (my terminal choice) themes, which is then applied on selection.
- **fd** (right-bottom) - fuzzy finder that searches the current directory for any subdirectories with a max depth of 3. And then changes into the selected directory.

I also made another one that replaces my existing alias for quickly committing
and pushing my local changes with Git, and makes the flow a bit more
interactive.

Previously I had an alias `gacp`, which basically meant (to me) "git add commit
push", and did the following:

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "$input"
git push
```

And I'd use it like this:

```bash
gacp "my wonderful code change"
```

But now with my (aptly) named tool, **gt**, I just need to type those two
letters, and it then lets me quickly run through the process of pushing my
latest changes.

First of all, it asks if I want to stage all my current changes (defaults to
yes), then it asks what type of commit it is (using conventional commit style),
asks for a commit message, and then if I want to push to my remote repo.

So a pretty simple process, but just a bit faster thanks to this little script.

As you can see, I'm clearly having a bit of fun writing these scripts, so don't
be surprised when I start uploading even more.

Although my next script/tool will definitely have to be making blog posts easier
to start writing. I have a half-baked bash script that creates a basic template,
but I think I want to make one with a bit more power, that can be flexible for
multiple types of posts. Let's see.
