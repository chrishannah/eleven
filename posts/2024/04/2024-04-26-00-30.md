If I ever switch away from using an iPhone, it would cause a massive cascading
effect on nearly every part of my digital (and some physical) life.

Simply because, if I could ever bring myself to break out of Apple's walled
garden, I would want to steer clear of anything similar. I wouldn't want to just
replace everything Apple with everything Google, for example. 

And yet, as much as I can imagine this would be hard work, I wouldn't say it's a
major part in why I still use an iPhone. And if I'm honest, the list of reasons
is slowly getting smaller and smaller.
