Last year I decided to upgrade to the **big** iPhone 15 Pro Max, after two years
of the iPhone 13 Pro. And while there are definitely benefits of a larger phone,
(and I've definitely enjoyed having it at times) there have been quite a few
times where I've been frustrated that it's not really usable with a single hand.

Not sure what that means for my next phone though. Because at times, I thought
the 13 Pro was too small for me.
