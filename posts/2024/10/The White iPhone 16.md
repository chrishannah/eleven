I just wanted to write a quick appreciation post for the white iPhone 16. It's a great size, it's super light, it feels great to hold, and it just looks god damn beautiful.

I had imagined there would be at least somewhat of a regret about going from a 15 Pro Max to "*just*" an iPhone 16. However, I can confirm that this is not the case. I do not regret this decision at all.

As an aside, I have this in the yellow (Star Fruit) silicone case most of the time, and it still looks great. But I do have to pop it out every now and then, because it is such a good looking phone.
