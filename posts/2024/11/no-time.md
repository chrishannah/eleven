I became a father just over four months ago. While that is one of the best things that's ever happened to me, it means I have less free time to spend on the less important things.

That includes keeping up with my RSS subscriptions, being active on social media (Mastodon), and sharing photos and updates on my blog.

I don't want to be negative though. It's just a fact that I have less time to spend on these things and that I also want to spend less time on them. I have much more important things people I want to spend time on.
But it does mean I post less to my blog, which is something I want to change.

I'm not sure if it will happen or how long any real improvement will take, but I think one first step has to be migrating this blog from Eleventy to something like Ghost.

The geek in me doesn't like the sound of that realisation. But with Eleventy, although I have total control of my site, how pages are built, the logic behind each template, and can also make changes to every minute detail, I don't find it that easy to just write a post.

Typically I use Neovim to write posts, which many people may point to as the main reason behind this friction. But it's also that my posts are plaintext Markdownfiles, with very particular frontmatter for the metadata, which is then committed to a Git repository, and deployed to Vercel.

That's cool, and somehow Vercel even hosts this blog for me for free. But it means it's a bit of a workflow to get even a simple blog posts published.

I'm sure there are various weird and wonderful workflows to publish to an Eleventy blog. But I don't have the time or patience to set them up. Which means when I have a quick idea for a post, or I just want to share a photo from my phone, it seems like too much effort and I just don't post anything.

I don't know if or when I will move my blog to something like Ghost or WordPress, but I'm starting to think that it's a likely future. Mainly because surely, whatever blog platform I move to, will require at least some level of migration work. And as the title indicates, I don't really have much time!

So you can take this post as an indication of where this blog may go soon, possibly a hint of positivity that I may end up writing more often in the near future. Or you could just take this as a sign that I'm still alive, and that there's at least a desire to keep a blog.

I guess I'll be back soon?
