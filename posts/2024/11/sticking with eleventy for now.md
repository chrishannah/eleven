I wrote recently about how [I don't have much time](https://chrishannah.me/no-time/) (or effort) to do spend much time on things like blogging. And that because this blog is a custom Eleventy site, which uses Markdown files, with specific frontmatter, kept track in GitHub, and then hosted via Vercel, it's becoming a bit of a faff when I want to quickly write and publish something to my blog.

I've spent 2 days looking into the possible futures of my blog, which essentially boiled down to WordPress or Ghost as the primary options. And to be completely honest, I wasn't happy enough with any of my attempts that I'd be willing to spend time in the short term to migrate to another platform.

With both platforms, I tried using various import tools, even using Perplexity to build various scripts that would take my Eleventy blog content and produce the correctly formatted files for each platform. 

The one for WordPress was the most accurate, but the photos weren't working properly, so I'd have to go through all of the posts manually anyway. Which is one thing I really wanted to avoid. 

Earlier today, I did even quickly sign up for a Business plan on WordPress.com, because it mentions it includes a free migration. Unfortunately, an Eleventy blog isn't the easiest to migrate, so they told me either to do it myself, or to pay $499 and their team would work with me to build "5+ pages". It's what I expected, but still unfortunate.

That leaves me with the realisation that any switch away from Eleventy will be quite a major undertaking. As in, it will require more than a few days effort on my part. ðŸ˜…

So I'm going to try *a bit* harder to make my Eleventy blog work for me. Maybe there's an automation for publishing that makes it easier to write posts on my phone, and I'm sure there's a lot more I can be doing with Obsidian templates. 

The bonus is that I'm now off work for nearly two weeks. So I've got a bit more time than usual to try and figure something out. Although, I still have a four month old child, so it's not a lot.
