title: Skateboarding Is Much More Than a Sport

<p>(This video is from last year, but everything in it is as true as it always has been).</p>

<p>Manuel ‘Manny’ Lopez and Daryl Dominguez aren’t just good mates, they’re two of the gnarliest skaters coming up in London. Always looking for a new challenge, we captured their night-long skate through the heart of The City.</p>
<p>In the first episode of our Own the Night series, created with Samsung, VICE Sports joins Manny and Daryl as they talk flow, creativity and skating – in a deserted, nocturnal London.</p>

<p>I spent <strong>a lot</strong> of my time growing up, skateboarding in London. And I can say I agree with everything said in this video. Skateboarding is more than a sport, or a basic hobby, it enables you to think differently about nearly everything in the world, and it&#8217;s such a creative thing to do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed a lot of similar traits in skateboarders, whether it&#8217;s the determination to get <em>that trick</em>, get back up after you&#8217;ve injured yourself, or to just think about stupidly innovative ideas, and turn boring city structures into super interesting and complex playgrounds. There&#8217;s also the added benefit of a broader perspective on things, as skateboarding usually takes you all around the world (including some locations that may or not be locked, closed off to public, or just in the middle of nowehere), and therefore you get to meet so many people from all sorts of backgrounds.</p>
<p>Plus, London at night is pretty cool all by itself.</p>
