title: Multiple Photos and Videos in One Instagram Post
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Instagram <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/157572774352/170222-multiple">announced on their blog</a>, that they now support adding up to 10 photos and videos in just the single post.</p>
<p>You now don&#8217;t have to worry about selecting the <em>best</em> photo, or not posting all of them because you don&#8217;t want to flood your followers feeds. This feature removes that problem.</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/204951185?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>The posts look nearly identical, except you can swipe left and right to navigate through the photos/videos. You&#8217;ll see if a post has many items, if you can see the line of blue dots beneath it.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re creating a new post on Instagram, you&#8217;ll see the new &#8220;Select Multiple&#8221; option appear, which means you can select up to 10 different items to appear in the post.</p>
<p>One you&#8217;ve done that you press Next as usual, and you can apply a filter to all of them at once, you can still select one of them and edit as usual. At the minute multiple photo/video posts only support square formats, and there is the one caption for the whole post.</p>

<p>This is a nice addition to Instagram, and one I would of made good use of in my recent trip to Barcelona. I like the idea of Instagram Stories, but sometimes I don&#8217;t want to worry about saving them manually to my phone just so I don&#8217;t lose them. Now instead of posting separate posts about the same event, you get to show more of your photography skills off in less space!</p>
<p>If for some reason you <em>haven&#8217;t</em> got Instagram, then you can <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=myself">download it from the App Store</a>.</p>
