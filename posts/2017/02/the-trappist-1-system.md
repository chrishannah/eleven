title: The TRAPPIST-1 System

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>A NASA telescope(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_Space_Telescope">Spitzer Space Telescope</a>) has <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-telescope-reveals-largest-batch-of-earth-size-habitable-zone-planets-around">discovered the largest batch of earth-size planets</a> orbiting a single star, and three of them are in the habitable zone. In total there are seven planets, and they all are possible candidates of having liquid water, however the three located in the habitable zone are the most likely.</p>
<p>This discovery is not only fascinating, and incredibly breathtaking, but it also breaks a few records. With this being the first known system of seven Earth-size planets around a single star, and the three planets in the habitable zone are also the highest number found around the single star outside of our solar system.</p>
<p>The system, named TRAPPIST-1 after The Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope, is about 40 light-years from Earth, but this is actually <em>relatively</em> close.</p>
<p>It will now be up to further observations to determine whether they contain liquid water, and also what their atmosphere is made up of.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m really excited to see what discoveries can be made in TRAPPIST-1, and maybe one of these will have the necessary ingredients needed for life to exist!</p>
