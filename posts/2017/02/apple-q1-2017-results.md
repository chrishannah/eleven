title: Apple Q1 2017 Results
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Earlier today, Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/01/apple-reports-record-first-quarter-results.html">announced their financial results</a> for the first fiscal quarter of 2017.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a huge amount of data, and I&#8217;ll leave that for other people to try to understand.</p>
<p>Put simply, this quarter was Apple&#8217;s all-time highest <strong>revenue of $78.4 billion</strong>, and also an all-time earnings per share record of 3.36. In this quarter they sold <strong>78.3 million iPhones</strong>, <strong>13.1 million iPads</strong>, and <strong>5.4 million Macs</strong> (That doesn&#8217;t sound dead to me).</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s not good enough for you, then over at MacStories <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-q1-2017-results-billion-revenue-million-iphones-million-ipads-sold/">John Voorhees has written a great article</a> covering everything you need to know, and of course it&#8217;s filled with their usual well designed graphs!</p>
