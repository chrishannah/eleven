title: More Pokemon to Catch in Pokemon GO!
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Later this week, there is an update to Pokemon GO that will bring over 80 new Pokemon to catch!</p>
<h3 id="pokemon">Pokemon</h3>
<p>The new Pokemon will be Gen 2, so from the Pokemon Gold and Silver games. You will be able to catch the three starters, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile, along with loads more!</p>
<h3 id="encounters">Encounters</h3>
<p>When you face a Pokemon in the wild, they will also react in a new way, there are no specifics yet though, so you’ll have to find out for yourself. While in an encounter, there will also be a simpler way to select and use items.</p>
<h3 id="berries">Berries</h3>
<p>From PokeStops, you’ll now be able to find berries. These can have various different effects, such as a Nanab Berry will slow a Pokemon’s movements, making it easier to catch, or a Pinap Berry which will double the amount of Candy you’ll receive if you catch the Pokemon on the next attempt.</p>
<h3 id="apparel">Apparel</h3>
<p>There’s also a few more pieces of apparel that you can use to customise your avatar, so it will be a bit less generic.</p>
<hr />
<p>It’s not a <em>huge</em> update, but it’s good to see that Pokemon GO is still moving forward. I’m still waiting for a battle system, where players will be able to battle each other, but I can only hope. For now, we’ll have to settle with trying to catch them all!</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/pokemon-go/id1094591345?mt=8&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=myself">download Pokemon GO from the App Store</a>.</p>
