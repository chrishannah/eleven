<p>David Sparks on <a href="http://radicalthinker.net/p/44ba1894-1ff1-40a5-a187-a68fdf237fc9/">the need to use tags</a> to manage files:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lately I’ve been thinking about making another run at file tagging. It’s kind of funny how these tech issues percolate up. It all started with some receipts that I wanted to save to both client folders and tax folders. I found myself creating duplicates to have them in two places at once, which rubs me, someone who used to save computer data onto a cassette tape, as fundamentally wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I’m looking at a hybrid tagging system that will still work with folders at some level but also rely on tags to help sort, store, and find files. There still are a lot of downsides to tagging. It takes extra time and it has very shaky support on iOS. I’m making a list of problems as I go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have moments like this where I think using file tagging would make my life so much easier, especially when I first found the feature to be quite interesting when first announced. However, when I decided to try out the feature, it never seems to stick with me. It was always a bigger task to set up, then to just deal with the problems one by one.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I am very interested to see what results David has, and it may spark myself again to try them out.</p>
