<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Apple have just released a one minute trailer of their Carpool Karaoke series, and with it comes a bit more information about the upcoming episodes.</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n2fipKCrV3I" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>Hollywood Reporter said last year that <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/carpool-karaoke-series-coming-exclusively-914692">Apple had ordered 16 episodes</a>, and we now know that they won&#8217;t all be hosted by James Corden. There may be people on multiple episodes still though, as they only mention 13 celebrities &#8220;and many more&#8221;. However they did say specifically &#8220;celebrity pairings&#8221;, so this seems like they&#8217;re moving the series away from a host/guest structure.</p>
<p>The thirteen celebrities already confirmed are: James Corden, Will Smith, Billy Eichner, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Michael Strahan, John Cena, and Shaquille Oâ€™Neal.</p>
<p>The series as we expected, will be <a href="http://applemusic.com/carpool">available exclusively on Apple Music</a>. I&#8217;m quite looking forward watching these, and also whether Apple can go on to create/produce/purchase even more content.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong><br />
Apple have now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSvOwwDexts">released a second video</a>, showing more of the series content!</p>
