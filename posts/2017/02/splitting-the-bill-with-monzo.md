title: Splitting The Bill with Monzo
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>In the latest update of the <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mondo/id1052238659?at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=myself">Monzo app</a> , they&rsquo;ve introduced a bill splitting feature, that is a cut above the rest. With the information that Monzo can already calculate form your transactions, such as the location, restaurant name, and even storing receipts, this feature simply makes sense.</p>

<h2 id="howtouseit">How To Use It</h2>
<p>Simply find a transaction in your Monzo app, and then select <strong>Split Cost Using <a href="http://Monzo.me">Monzo.me</a></strong>. You&rsquo;ll be presented with a list of options, where you can quickly share the bill with 1 to 4 other people, or you can also set a custom amount to request.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve selected an amount to request, you&rsquo;re presented with the standard iOS Share Sheet, and this means you can send it wherever, and however you like! Whether it&rsquo;s through iMessage, WhatsApp, or some magical Workflow!</p>

Then once you or your friend have received the link, they can then pay directly on any device, including from a browser on their laptop! It also supports Apple Pay, so if you&rsquo;re on an Apple Pay supported device, you can literally pay your end of the bill in seconds.</p>
<h2 id="whocanuseit">Who Can Use It?</h2>
<p>You can ask anyone to pay you, by using your own personal <a href="http://Monzo.me">Monzo.me</a> link. From there, they&rsquo;ll be able to use their own card (even non-Monzo cards) to pay you back.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no fees involved, so the amount that&rsquo;s sent, is exactly the amount that is received. Of course the <a href="http://Monzo.me">Monzo.me</a> website is fully secure, accepts any major debit card, and in usual Monzo style, the money appears in less than a minute.</p>
<hr />
<p>This update to the Monzo app, takes them even further forward in comparison to other payment providers, and even full banks. Even though it&rsquo;s just a prepaid debit card at the moment, there are literally so many things that Monzo let&rsquo;s you do, that no-one else does.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://monzo.com?ref=radicalthinker">read more about Monzo on their website</a> , and <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mondo/id1052238659?at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=myself">download the Monzo app for iOS from the App Store</a> .</p>
<p>If you want to quickly see what a payment request looks like, then <a href="https://monzo.me/christopherrichardhannah/0.99?d=%F0%9F%91%8C%F0%9F%8F%BB%20Radical%20Thinker">here&rsquo;s an example</a> I made up. Of course you won&rsquo;t be forced to actually pay anything, but you can see what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
