<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>There’s a new Pokémon movie coming out (the 20th actually), and it’s by far one of the most significant they’ve ever made.</p>
<p>Instead of continuing the timeline of Ash and his many companions, they’re using it to celebrate all the adventures between Ash and Pikachu, that have happened across the tv-series and the other movies.</p>
<p>I won’t spoil too much about the film, because it’s probably best to just watch the trailer, and let it all come flooding back in. All I will say is, it starts right back at the beginning! And it contains so much stuff, I seriously don’t know how they will fit everything in.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHzLY27I6w4">Trailer</a>:</p>

<p>As always, there’s a few benefits you get from going to see a Pokemon movie. You can get a code for Pokémon Sun/Moon to allow your Pikachu to wear Ash’s hat. Or for Pokémon Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon, you&#8217;ll receive a QR code that will grant you a Pikachu wearing the hat that Ash wears in the movie.</p>

<p>However, there’s something else that’s just <em>brilliant</em>. They will give you a special edition card for the Pokémon TCG!</p>
<p>Maybe that isn’t a big deal on it’s own. But I remember when I saw the first Pokémon movie at the cinema. I came out after watching the film, and was presented with a free poster, and a Pikachu trading card! To be honest, I don’t know where the card is anymore, but I still want this one.</p>
