title: IMDB Top Something Workflow
---

<p>I just spent my evening making a workflow that requests the top however many movies from IMDB, parses the title, ranking, year, url, and short description, and adds them to Todoist as separate items.</p>
<p>It was a bit of a pain, especially as there’s a 2 second wait between each Todoist task. But otherwise it kept hitting request limits.</p>
<p>To make the workflow work properly, you’ll need to get an API token, but there is a link in the workflow for this. Oh, and of course you’ll need Todoist. Unless you just want to change that, but still use the extracted information.</p>
