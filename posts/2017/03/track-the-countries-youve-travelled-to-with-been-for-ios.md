title: Track the Countries You’ve Travelled to with “been” for iOS
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>If you like to travel, then it&rsquo;s pretty much guaranteed that you&rsquo;d be interested in mapping out where you&rsquo;ve actually been. This is because I&rsquo;m exactly the same. I&rsquo;ve come across a few apps in the past that are complex travelling journal type applications, but they never seem to stick with me, because they&rsquo;re just too much.</p>
<p>Well today I&rsquo;ve found another app for iOS called &ldquo;been&rdquo;, which does the job in a near-perfect way.</p>

<p>With been, you add all the places you&rsquo;ve travelled to, and it then colours in these on a map. The only choices you have are to add a whole country, or an individual U.S. state. In a perfect world I&rsquo;d like to specify each city I&rsquo;ve travelled to, but this is a minor issue.</p>
<p>But once you&rsquo;ve added your travels, then you get to check the maps out. You can choose to either view a 2D map, or a 3D globe, which can be exported as an image or video respectively. If you want to make your map a bit more specific, then while viewing the 2D map you can select a continent which will show you just that on a map.</p>

<p>After adding all of my travels, apparently I&rsquo;ve only been to 4% of the world, which I certainly need to improve on! But I&rsquo;ve generated both the 2D World map image, and the 3D globe video, which you can check out below as an example.</p>

<p>If you want to mark up your travels on a map like I did, then you can download <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/been/id680148327?mt=8&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=theapplife">&ldquo;been&rdquo; for iOS from the App Store</a> for free! It works on both the iPhone and iPad. &#x1F30D;</p>
