<blockquote>
<p>In a world where people like Elon Musk are literally building rockets and cars that run on energy from the sun it’s easy to look at your own life as an entrepreneur and feel like a bit of a failure or be totally dismissive when people acknowledge your success or compliment you. Sure maybe you’re not changing the world at the same scale as Elon but you are no doubt having an impact on countless people’s lives through job creation and that alone is commendable.</p>

<p>This was a nice little read, and I agree with everything he says.</p>
