<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a user of many different task managers over the years, but one I&rsquo;ve tried before, and what I&rsquo;ve finally settled on is Todoist.</p>
<p>My main philosophies regarding task managers are that they should be stable, and by that I mean it should be something you can rely on, you should be able to view your upcoming tasks everywhere possible, and the syncing should be very fast. With all of these requirements, Todoist is the choice that makes the most sense, because at a fundamental level it is a web service, not just a collection of apps, which makes it a super stable platform.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-452" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-16-at-14-09-58.png" alt=""  /></p>
<p>The main way to organise tasks in Todoist is by assigning them to projects, which you can also further organise with sub-projects. I have split my tasks into context relevant projects, so for example I have a University project, and inside this I split up any coursework or big chunks of work into a sub-project. This structure makes it much easier to visualise your tasks, especially when you input a load of small tasks like I do.</p>
<p>As you can see in the screenshot above, I also use emoji in my project names. This is just so I can find the right section at a quick glance. There&rsquo;s also the added benefit of using an emoji first in the project name, which is that it always puts these at the top of the list. This is because an emoji character will always come before the usual alphabetical characters. Luckily I only have a few top-level projects, so this doesn&rsquo;t affect my list.</p>
<h2 id="labelsandfilters">Labels and Filters</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-453" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-16-at-14-17-55.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Another away to organise and view your tasks is by using labels and filters. Labels offer a separate way to collect tasks together, which can of course be used in conjunction with projects. A common use of this is to have labels such as &ldquo;admin&rdquo; or &ldquo;writing&rdquo;, or even time-based names such as &ldquo;quick&rdquo; so that when you only have a specific amount of time available to get some work done, you can find suitable tasks can be completed.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-454" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-16-at-14-18-19.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Filters are ways to view your tasks, by applying some criteria to fine-tune your results. If working in a team, viewing tasks assigned to different users would be quite helpful, but I don&rsquo;t personally make use of them.</p>
<h2 id="addingtasks">Adding Tasks</h2>
<p>The three main ways you can add a task is by using the &ldquo;Quick Add Task&rdquo; method, which is accessed pressing the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button, or by hitting the &ldquo;q&rdquo; key while in Todoist, by pressing the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button or by pressing the &ldquo;A&rdquo; or &ldquo;a&rdquo; key to add a task to the top or bottom of the current list, and also by using the &ldquo;Quick Add Task&rdquo; method outside of the app.</p>
<p>With apps such as Fantastical, inputting data has become much easier with the support of real language entry. So if I want to to add a task for university I can simply open up the Add Task view by pressing CMD + SHIFT + A, and then by typing &ldquo;Finish Lecture Notes #University&rdquo;, this will add a task with the entered name, and subsequently organise it into the University project. You can take this even further by adding dates and labels, so when I decide I want to write about an app, I can add a task like &ldquo;Write about App X today #TheAppLife @Writing&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a feature that once you learn how to make use of all the little tricks, you will really love to use.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-455" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-16-at-14-28-34.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="overduetasks">Overdue Tasks</h2>
<p>Something I haven&rsquo;t seen before in other task managers is a ways to quickly reorganise overdue tasks. It is a feature that Todoist has, and one I have found to be very useful, especially when I plan way too much work for one day and end up leaving a few incomplete.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-456" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-16-at-14-36-23.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Todoist&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://blog.todoist.com/2016/11/16/todoist-smart-schedule/">Smart Schedule</a>&rdquo; is an AI powered feature that uses your habits, the urgency of tasks, your upcoming tasks, and even uses learned patterns from the other Todoist users, to help find the the best suited day to fit them in. So far the suggestions have been pretty spot on for me.</p>
<h2 id="yourproductivity">Your Productivity</h2>
<p>This is a feature that it&rsquo;s use continues to elude me, by competing tasks, and keeping up streaks, Todoist grants you &ldquo;Karma&rdquo;. These are all calculated by configurable goals, and I guess gives you a glance on how well you&rsquo;ve been performing.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, it doesn&rsquo;t affect the usability of the app, because I don&rsquo;t see myself making use of this in the future.</p>
<hr />
<p>What I&rsquo;ve found Todoist to be, is a fully featured, easy to use, and stable task manager to can really adapt to my own needs. I would recommend this to all users that are wanting to start using a task manager, and see if it fits them.</p>
