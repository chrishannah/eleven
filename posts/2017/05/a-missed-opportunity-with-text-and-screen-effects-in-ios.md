<p>David Sparks on the <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2017/5/a-missed-opportunity-with-text-and-screen-effects-in-ios">missed opportunity of text  and screen effects in iOS</a>, and specifically iMessage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When iOS 10 was first released, I made the argument that to keep these relevant, Apple needed to constantly iterate and update them. If you&#8217;ve ever spent any time with Snapchat, you know what I&#8217;m talking about. Snapchat regularly releases new filters and effects that you can apply to your images. They often change seasonally and even for particular holidays. Watching my children and their friends, they all get a kick out of whatever the latest and greatest Snapchat filter is.</p>
<p>I think Apple had a similar opportunity with text and screen effects in iOS messaging. Why not render text with snowflakes during the winter? Why not have a screen effect with flowers blooming in the spring?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with all of the points David makes, and with the recent TV ads and a bigger focus on iMessage stickers, I think they should also work on these effects a bit more. I&#8217;m not saying they should go mad, but maybe a seasonal advert, and a few extra effects every now and then would be a massive improvement.  Some people don&#8217;t even know that they exist, so surely just meeting that mark would be beneficial.</p>
