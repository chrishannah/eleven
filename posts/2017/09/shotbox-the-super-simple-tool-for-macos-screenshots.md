title: ShotBox - The Super Simple Tool for macOS Screenshots
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>I’ve been wanting (not exactly looking for) a better way to quickly deal with screenshots on macOS for a while, and while looking over <a href="https://ambassador.producthunt.com/@chrishannah">Product Hunt</a> today, there was an app called <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/shotbox">ShotBox</a> climbing the ranks.</p>
<p>It was free, and it looked interesting, so I gave it a shot. I was very pleased with what I found, and it’s such a simple utility, but it’s exactly what I need.</p>

<p>It’s similar to the new screenshot feature in iOS, in that when it detects a new screenshot, it opens up a small window in the bottom-left corner, so you can quickly edit and share.</p>

<p>There are actually only two things you can do in that window, and they are preview and edit. And of course when you close the window, you get the option to quickly delete the screenshot, or to save it.</p>
<p>I initially didn’t think it would work properly on my Mac, as I have Hazel move my screenshots into a separate folder, which I then have rules on archiving. So therefore they don’t just sit on my desktop. However, ShotBox lets you select a folder to watch, so this wasn’t an issue!</p>
<p>You can find out more information on ShotBox, and also download it for free using these links:</p>
