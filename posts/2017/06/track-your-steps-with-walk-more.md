title: Track Your Steps With Walk More
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>My friend Cesare Forelli has just released his fourth app, and it&rsquo;s a pedometer to help keep track of how far you&rsquo;ve walked.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-429" src="https://chrishannah.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Image.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple application, in that it&rsquo;s primarily a way to view your walking data, but that&rsquo;s not all it does.</p>
<p>It tracks your steps, the distance you actually walked, and if you&rsquo;re on an iPhone 6 or newer it also shows you how many stairs have climbed.</p>
<p>This data is combined with a set goal, which is an amount of steps you want to hit every day. This is all presented in main ring, but if you swipe to the left you will also get to see the Stats view. Here you can find your past steps and distance walked, but also other data points such as the most steps walked, longest distance, and most floors in a single day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a today widget, that let&rsquo;s you keep on top of your walking at a glance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the interface, and how it shows everything I <em>need</em> to see, and in a beautiful way.</p>
<p>Walk More is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/walk-more-powerful-pedometer-for-step-counting/id1198077980?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010l4Hj&amp;ct=bftweet">free to download on the App Store</a>, but there&rsquo;s also a few tip options in the settings, just in case you want to help keep the app going!</p>
