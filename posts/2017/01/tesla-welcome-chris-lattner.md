<blockquote>
<p>We would like to welcome Chris Lattner, who will join Tesla as our Vice President of Autopilot Software. Chrisâ€™s reputation for engineering excellence is well known. He comes to Tesla after 11 years at Apple where he was primarily responsible for creating Swift, the programming language for building apps on Apple platforms and one of the fastest growing languages for doing so on Linux. Prior to Apple, Chris was lead author of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, an open source umbrella project that is widely used in commercial products and academic research today. &#8211; <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/welcome-chris-lattner">Tesla Blog</a></p>
