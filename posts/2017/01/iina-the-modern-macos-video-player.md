title: IINA - The Modern macOS Video Player
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>I&#8217;ve just found <a href="https://lhc70000.github.io/iina/?ref=radicalthinker.net">IINA</a> on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/iina?ref=radicalthinker.net">Product Hunt</a>, which in my opinion shows great potential to be <em>the</em> video player for macOS.</p>
<p>Of course as I&#8217;m currently writing this, it is only v0.0.1 build 1, so there&#8217;s going to be some bugs, and maybe a few missing features. But this is one hell of a first build.</p>
<p>Here are the features from the GitHub page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on mpv, a powerful media player</li>
<li>Designed for modern macOS (10.10+)</li>
<li>User-friendly interface</li>
<li>All the features you need for videos, audios and subtitles</li>
<li>Supported basic playlist and chapters</li>
<li>MPV config files and script system are available for advanced users</li>
<li>Written in Swift, followed up on new technologies like Touch Bar</li>
<li>Still in active development</li>
</ul>
<p>The best bit in my opinion, is the video, audio, and subtitle controls you get. It&#8217;s such a simple aesthetic, but it certainly packs in some power!</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots:</p>
