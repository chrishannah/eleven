title: My Opinions on Setapp

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>A few days ago <a href="http://setapp.com/">Setapp</a> was released to the public, but I was fortunate enough to be in the beta, so I&#8217;ve had a lot of experience with it. If you don&#8217;t know about Setapp already, it&#8217;s  a subscription-based service that gives users access to a huge bunch of great macOS apps.</p>
<p>If I calculate correctly, this is my second month using Setapp, and it&#8217;s been great. I&#8217;ve had access to so many great applications, that before I wouldn&#8217;t of even thought about, or even heard of.</p>
<p>But after all of this time, there&#8217;s only a few applications that I have actually launched:</p>
<ul>
<li>CleanMyMac</li>
<li>CodeRunner</li>
<li>iStat Menus</li>
<li>MoneyWiz</li>
<li>Ulysses</li>
</ul>
<p>CleanMyMac is something I&#8217;ve ran a few times, just so I could get an idea on the state of my new MacBook.</p>
<p>CodeRunner is actually quite a nifty application, it&#8217;s basically a text editor for programmers, that can actually compile and execute code itself. I played around with this a few times when doing Java at university, but it wasn&#8217;t something I stuck with.</p>
<p>iStat Menus is probably the only consistent app I use from Setapp, and that&#8217;s really just providing me with a few useful stats, that I could realistically live without. Because my Mac isn&#8217;t at any stage where I need to worry about resources.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve opened MoneyWiz about three times, once to set it up, and then twice to check out my transactions. It&#8217;s a nice idea, but not something I need.</p>
<p>Ulysses, maybe my favourite application out of the lot. But I&#8217;ve been doing a bit less writing recently, so I haven&#8217;t used it as much. I do have iA Writer, and then there&#8217;s Bear, so it&#8217;s not a necessity, although Ulysses is a well made app.</p>
<p>From a usability point of view, Setapp has worked perfectly. And it does provide a great deal of applications for a little amount  of money a month.</p>
<p>However, my problem is that I simply don&#8217;t <em>need</em> these applications. And although a few of them are nice to have, it doesn&#8217;t warrant any kind of subscription fee.</p>
