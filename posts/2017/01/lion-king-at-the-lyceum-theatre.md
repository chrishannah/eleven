title: Lion King at The Lyceum Theatre

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>I&#8217;m just on the way home from <em>finally</em> seeing Lion King at the theatre. It was one of my favourite movies growing up, so it certainly had a lot to live up to.</p>
<p>In general I think that it was pretty good, there were some bits that were really enjoyable, and others not so much.</p>
<p>My favourite characters were easily Rafiki and Pumba, because they seemed the most &#8220;realistic&#8221;, and the songs seemed to be near original with them.</p>
<p>What I didn&#8217;t like was when scenes were added or removed. I understand that it may be slightly different, but there was a 2/3 minute scene that just <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> in the film. A slightly smaller example is when Timone and Pumba are tasked with distracting the Hyenas, instead of the little song and dance I remember from the movies, there was some random Irish dancing?</p>
<p>Of course there was some Frozen references, but I guess we can&#8217;t escape that anymore.</p>
<p>So as I said before, it was <em>pretty good</em>.</p>
<p>I would encourage people to see it, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be going a second time.o</p>
