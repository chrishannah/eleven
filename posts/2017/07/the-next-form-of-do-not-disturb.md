<p>Joe Cieplinski on his <a href="http://www.joecieplinski.com/blog/2017/07/16/the-next-form-of-do-not-disturb/">ideal version of Do Not Disturb</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Do you want to tell this person to shut the hell up?”</p>
<p>If at least two people tap “Yes” the other person’s phone hangs up automatically and refuses to take any new calls.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d have to agree.</p>
