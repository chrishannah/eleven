<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>There’s a big change this week, and it’s the transition from being the “Weekly Links” newsletter, to the “Chris Hannah Blog &#8211; Newsletter”. A bit wordy, but that’s technically what it is, maybe it could use a better name.</p>
<p>Anyway, the new newsletter is an extension of the initial format, with it now covering a wider array of content. So instead of just being a list of links, it will include videos, what I’ve been up to on the blog, what I’m currently working on, and hopefully even more in the future.</p>
<p>I won’t bore you too much about it, but I <a href="#">wrote about the changes on my blog</a>.</p>

Weird, but interesting.</p>

A great mini-guide from Sam Soffes, I’ll be using this myself!</p>

I was a fan of the original Pixel, and I quite like the look of this one too. I can’t see anything pulling me from my iPhone 7+ though, especially as there’s literally no other way to enjoy iOS.</p>

I’m not a user of 1Password (I had a trial, but didn’t use it enough to warrant buying), but it doesn’t look like it’s going in the right direction.</p>

I understand why people care about this stuff, but I always find  these types of posts quite funny, and very #firstworldproblems.</p>
<h2 id="videos">Videos</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2d9XDn1bSg&amp;index=7&amp;list=LLRaI6U3DIRISyYv7o4Tdw-Q">Remarkable Time-Lapse: Watch Caterpillars Transform Into Butterflies | National Geographic</a><br />
I found their method pretty weird, and maybe a bit unethical (on a minuscule scale), but this is a great video!</p>

I bet you’ve never heard of that before.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NelIXCuuSZ0&amp;index=1&amp;list=LLRaI6U3DIRISyYv7o4Tdw-Q">How Penn Jillette Lost over 100 Lbs and Still Eats Whatever He Wants</a><br />
It’s obviously a clickbait title, but there’s a lot of truth behind it. And it’s worth a watch.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.realm.io/news/altconf-2017-stephen-hackett-the-reality-of-indie-developer-life/">The Reality of Indie Life </a><br />
A really great talk by Stephen Hackett about becoming an indie, the problems he faced and how he overcame them, and a few other interesting topics.</p>

<h2 id="whatimupto">What I’m Up To</h2>
<p>Right now I have a few projects in “progress”, some are really in progress, and there’s one still stuck in my head.</p>
<p>My <em>biggest?</em> project is <a href="https://chrishannah.me/hydrate/">Hydrate</a>, and that is a water intake app for iOS, which is actually in Beta. It has over 100 beta testers at the minute, so this is one of my priorities.</p>
<p>Then there is the mini-project, which is the process of myself cleaning up my blog, and optimising everything to make it as lean as possible.</p>
<p>The final project, is something I have already wrote about on my blog, but just to put them all in one place &#8211; I want to make an alternative to Google Analytics. I’m not actually going “big” for this one, because it’s a personal thing that I want myself, but I think I know how I’m going to do it now.</p>
