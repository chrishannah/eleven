<p>Another week, and one full of content again!</p>
<h2 id="interestinglinks">Interesting Links</h2>

Will anyone except tech journalists notice this?</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t heard anyone speak the name iPod in a long time.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.macpaw.com/post/163484103673/macpaw-bought-unarchiver">MacPaw acquires The Unarchiver and commits to&#8230; | MacPaw Blog</a><br />
The Unarchiver app for macOS is probably the most popular one of its kind (that isn&#8217;t a System app), and MacPaw are a great bunch of people! So this can only be a good thing (Unless Iâ€™m missing something?).</p>
<h2 id="videos">Videos</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufBLI6bB9sg">iPhone 7 â€” The Rock x SiriÂ Dominate the Day â€” Apple</a><br />
I like it!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMr-WzCIXYI">Make time: Why we spend our most productive time on the wrong things (Google Cloud Next &#8217;17)</a><br />
Super interesting video here, packed with some great tips and lots of data!</p>
<p>(Donâ€™t tell anyone, but Android from these kind of perspective looks really intriguing)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSnoYEzZnUg">Tesla Project Loveday Contest Entry!</a><br />
Iâ€™m not sure what this Loveday thing is (Iâ€™m honestly not that interested), but this video from Marques (MKBHD) is really good!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpiDADw5Omw">The bizarre physics of fire ants</a><br />
Weird</p>

<h2 id="whatimupto">What Iâ€™m Up To</h2>
<p>Over the past week, I have done a few interesting things, mainly working on my app Hydrate, and a few other meta tasks.</p>
<p>I canâ€™t remember exactly what was finished this week, but the main thing was the history view. So you can now see your water intake for the past 21 days! I was meaning to do this right from the start, but I really couldnâ€™t be bothered! However over last weekend, I was away in Norfolk with rather bad internet, so I forced myself to get on with it then.</p>
<p>As for what else I was getting up to, Ghost (the blog platform this runs on) was updated to v1.0! Which meant (what I thought would be huge) migration task, as it used MySQL instead of SQLite, and also a few syntax changes for themes. The whole process actually only took me about an hour, so that was done in one lunch time at work.</p>
<p>It did get a bit bad though, as I got a bit trigger happy with linux commands, and ended up completely destroying the permissions. So everything slowly stopped working. In the end I realised I had everything backed up perfectly, so I created a new droplet on Digital Ocean and put it all back to normal! Lessons were learned!</p>
