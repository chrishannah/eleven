<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Lisa Friedman, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/climate/syria-joins-paris-agreement.html">writing for The New York Times</a>:</p>

The move, which comes on the heels of Nicaragua signing the accord last month, will leave the United States as the only country that has rejected the global pact.<br />

The Paris agreement, struck in 2015 under former President Barack Obama, calls on nearly 200 countries to voluntarily curb greenhouse gas emissions. At the time, only Nicaragua and Syria did not join, for very different reasons.</p></blockquote>
