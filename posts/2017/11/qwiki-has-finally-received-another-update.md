title: Qwiki Has Finally Received Another Update!
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>I finally got around to checking out the code for one of my apps, Qwiki.</p>
<p>Qwiki is a menu bar application, that lets you search and read Wikipedia articles. It can also open them in the browser, share differently formatted links, etc. But this isn&#8217;t an advertisement.</p>
<p>After updating it to 1.3 <em>last year</em>, I had other projects, university, and finding a job to do. So it got pushed right to the side. But I decided recently I wanted to modernise it, and maybe even look at adding new features.</p>
<p>That time hasn&#8217;t come yet, but I have spent the past few days going over the code, cleaning a few things up, migrating it to Swift 4, etc.</p>
<p>So in the mean time I fixed a couple of bugs, like when keyboard and mouse input get mixed up, escape key not always working, some design tweaks, and also added a preference to keep Qwiki open unless manually dismissed.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s been sent to Apple, I&#8217;ll have a few days off, and probably work updating another one of my apps. But in the very near future I plan on going back to Qwiki, and seeing what <strong>real</strong> features I can add!</p>
<p>If you have any ideas at all about Qwiki, then i&#8217;d be really happy to heat them. Even if it&#8217;s pure criticism, it all helps.</p>
