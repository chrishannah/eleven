<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>It happens every year, and as usual there’s some <strong>great</strong> news for World of Warcraft fans.</p>
<p>As WoW expansions usually come out every two years, this year is just to announce the expansion, and usually that’s it. One logo, maybe small description, and a year wait.</p>
<p>Except this year, in the opening ceremony, they showed three videos. One about a new feature, and then for the expansion there was a feature video, and even a cinematic trailer!</p>
<h2 id="worldofwarcraftclassic">World of Warcraft: Classic</h2>
<p>With the original version of WoW being one of the best gaming experiences for nearly all WoW players. Blizzard have announced that they’re working on a classic server mode for the game. So you will be able to play the <em>original</em> game, before any expansions!</p>
<p>I’m really looking forward to this!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcZyiYOzsSw">Here’s their video announcement</a>:</p>

<h2 id="worldofwarcraftbattleforazeroth">World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth</h2>
<p>Okay, I won’t go too deep into the expansion here. Because <em>so much</em> has been announced, and there’s going to be so much more.</p>
<p>All I will say is if you want to know <strong>everything</strong> about it, <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/battle-for-azeroth">check out the website</a>.</p>
<p>But you also need to watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsZ9xkVQ_Vs">features overview</a>, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJr3dXZfcg">cinematic trailer</a>!</p>

<p>I don’t want to spoil anything here, because it is really impressive. Although I’m also looking forward to play the classic version just as much.</p>
