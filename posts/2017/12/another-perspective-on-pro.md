title: Another Perspective on "Pro"
---

<p>Just another perspective on the iMac Pro and generic “Pro&#8221; definition debate:</p>
<p>What if a “Pro&#8221; user had nothing to do with their understanding of how the device works, or the ability to fix any potential issues, but instead a user that uses a device for professional purposes.</p>
<p>For example, a video editor, music producer, and even some designers and developers, don’t need to know the intricacies about their Mac. They just need it to be able to do what they need to do for their role. And that still makes them a Pro user.</p>
