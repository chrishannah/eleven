<blockquote><p>As Spotify continues to inch towards a public listing, Apple is making a move of its own to step up its game in music services. Sources tell us that the company is close to acquiring Shazam, the popular app that lets people identify any song, TV show, film or advert in seconds, by listening to an audio clip or (in the case of, say, an ad) a visual fragment, and then takes you to content relevant to that search.</p>
<p>We have heard that the deal is being signed this week, and will be announced on Monday, although that could always change.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ever since Shazam was first integrated into Siri, I only ever thought of this as the long term solution. Simply buying them to tidy it all up would be worth it in my opinion. However I assume they will gain a lot more than just that.</p>
