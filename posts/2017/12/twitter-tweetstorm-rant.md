title: Better Support for Tweetstorms, Exactly What Twitter Needed!
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>From the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/nicethreads.html?ref=chrishannah.me">Twitter Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve made it easy to create a thread by adding a plus button in the composer, so you can connect your thoughts and publish your threaded Tweets all at the same time. You can continue adding more Tweets to your published thread at any time with the new “Add another Tweet” button. Additionally, it’s now simpler to spot a thread – we’ve added an obvious “Show this thread” label. &#8211; <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/nicethreads.html?ref=chrishannah.me">Full announcement.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>As much as I think this is a good addition to the Twitter app, even though my thoughts on tweetstorms are mixed, I can&#8217;t help but thinking that they&#8217;re still not working on the important things.</p>

<p>It sounds stupid, and I understand there&#8217;s different departments for different things. But the native Mac app doesnt even support 280 characters yet.</p>
<p>And what about all the god damn abuse!</p>
<p>I was a bit weary of blaming Twitter directly for these types of issues, where maybe things such as blocking, or other reactionary actions could help. But it&#8217;s a <strong>real</strong> mess.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a massive fan of Twitter. But if certain people can&#8217;t use it because of things like abuse, safeguarding issues, the special treatment some people get even when they break such basic rules (especially that prat with the blonde combover), then you&#8217;re doing something fundamentally wrong.</p>
<p>In no way is this me trying to create a comprehensive list of the problems with Twitter. I don&#8217;t have enough patience to write about them all. But it pisses me off when I see constant &#8220;improvements&#8221; to the things that don&#8217;t really matter.</p>
