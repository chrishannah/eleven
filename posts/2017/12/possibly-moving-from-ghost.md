title: Possibly Moving From Ghost
---

<p>I&#8217;m starting to seriously consider moving my blog over from Ghost. It&#8217;s a really minimal and easy to use platform, except I know of no apps that support publishing to it.</p>
<p>There is a “native” app for Mac, but it&#8217;s pretty much just a web view. And I really cant be bothered working out the API to make some custom publishing workflows.</p>
