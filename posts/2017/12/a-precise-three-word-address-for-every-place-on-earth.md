<p>Chris Sheldrick had an idea to make addresses better for the entire planet, and inside just one TED talk he explained how it works, the current progress, and how it can make everyones lives better.</p>
<blockquote><p>With what3words, Chris Sheldrick and his team have divided the entire planet into three-meter squares and assigned each a unique, three-word identifier, like famous.splice.writers or blocks.evenly.breed, giving a precise address to the billions of people worldwide who don&#8217;t have one. In this quick talk about a big idea, Sheldrick explains the economic and political implications of giving everyone an accurate address &#8212; from building infrastructure to sending aid to disaster zones to delivering hot pizza.</p></blockquote>
