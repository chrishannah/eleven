title: Apparently Apple Plan to Combine iOS and macOS Apps ü§î
---

<p>In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps">recent article by Mark Gurman over at Bloomberg</a>, he wrote over 600 words on the supposed plan that Apple have, which would converge apps from iOS and macOS. Meaning that developers would be able to <em>design just one app</em>, and have it work on both platforms.</p>
<p>I personally dont think this is going to happen.</p>
<p>And if you read the whole piece, you&#8217;ll find that only 48 words out of the total 672 are relevant:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Apple currently plans to begin rolling out the change as part of next fall‚Äôs major iOS and macOS updates, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter. The secret project, codenamed ‚ÄúMarzipan,‚Äù is one of the tentpole additions for next year‚Äôs Apple software road map.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been hearing Mark&#8217;s name for a few years, and people always seem to make him sound like a very top Apple reporter, which I guess is why he now writes for Bloomberg. But his latest rumours, have been a bit lower in quality in my opinion.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps">Read the <em>&#8220;full&#8221;</em> article on Bloomberg.</a></p>
