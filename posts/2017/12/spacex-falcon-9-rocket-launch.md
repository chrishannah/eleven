title: SpaceX Falcon 9 Rocket Launch Timelapse
---

<p>Jesse Watson has just published a <a href="https://vimeo.com/248591160">time-lapse he shot of the recent SpaceX launch</a>. You know, the one that looked really strange, and not like any rocket we’ve seen before. However the video is of course over a much longer period of time, and shows a wider angle of everything that went on.</p>
<p>He filmed it from Yuma Arizona, roughly 400 miles away from the launch site. And it took quite a bit of planning:</p>
<blockquote><p>I scouted four locations that had foregrounds to add depth to the imagery and was uniquely inspiring to my hometown. Location choices were between a favorite local hiking mountain, the Imperial Sand Dunes, or a small hill that resides in the historic downtown area overlooking the city. I ended up choosing the location that overlooked the city, partially because it was the easiest to access with all of my time-lapse gear. I used The Photographer’s Ephemeris and Google Maps to help scouting and initial line up.</p>
<p>I have never shot a rocket launch before, so I did not know exactly what to expect as far as exposure or precise location of the rocket in the horizon. I wanted to be prepared to capture comprehensive coverage of the spectacle. Therefore I packed four cameras and five lenses, to cover wide to telephoto details of the scene. Three of the cameras were rolling time-lapse and 1 was setup for telephoto video.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s certainly an interesting story, and also a fantastic video.</p>
