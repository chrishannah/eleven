<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>Christoph Neimann, in conjunction with <a href="http://www.nationalgeographicexpeditions.com/expeditions/norway-arctic-cruise/detail?utm_source=NGdotcom-Travel&amp;utm_medium=InPagePromo&amp;utm_content=201703_Svalbard&amp;utm_campaign=NGdotcom">National Geographic Expeditions</a>, has published what he calls an “Illustrated Travelogue”.</p>
<p>During a trip to Norway’s Svalbard islands, Christoph was taking some photographs, but on top of that were his illustrations. The way the story has been published is rather interesting too, with some nice effects, transitions, and the story telling is really nice.</p>
<p>It sounds like an amazing trip, and an equally impressive story.</p>
