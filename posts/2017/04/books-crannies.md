<p>My sister has started blogging again, and I thought I&#8217;d just post a link here, for anyone that may be interested.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called &#8220;<a href="https://jadeehannah.wordpress.com/">Books &amp; Crannies</a>&#8220;, and as you can imagine, it&#8217;s all book-related. Or as she puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Ramblings of Someone Who Likes Books More Than People</p></blockquote>
