<p>Joe Cieplinski, on <a href="http://www.joecieplinski.com/blog/2017/04/21/id-like-to-request-a-review-prompt-please/">the way iOS handles review prompts</a>, and the way developers have to implement them:</p>
<blockquote><p>While working on my latest update of Fin, I spent a bit of time playing with Apple’s new SKStoreReviewController API.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, this new API was announced with the early betas of iOS 10.3, and it went live with the 10.3 release last month. Though it isn’t the only approved way to prompt a customer to rate your app on the App Store yet, that is Apple’s ultimate intention. Like it or not, you’ll have to learn to work with this thing eventually, in other words. Unless you never prompt for reviews.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the way apps now ask for reviews on iOS, or maybe just want to find out a developers perspective, Joe explains the pros and cons very nicely.</p>
