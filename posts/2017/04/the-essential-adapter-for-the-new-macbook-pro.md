title: The Essential Adapter for the New MacBook Pro
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>If like me, you&#8217;ve got a new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, you may get yourself in a situation where the ports just aren&#8217;t enough.</p>
<p>With the MacBook Pro, the ports you have access to are:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 x USB C / Thunderbolt</li>
<li>1 x 3.5mm Headphone Jack</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all perfect, until you need to plug in an external display, or have an old USB A drive you want to use. For sure, there are adapters everywhere, and you can literally find any combination of dongles.</p>
<p>The problem arises when you have adapters that break over time, or when using multiple adapters, they tend to get lost.</p>
<p>Well, a while ago I backed something on Kickstarter called HyperDrive. It&#8217;s an adapter that is more of an extension, as it just slots on to the side of the Mac, and turns 2 USB C ports into a lot more.</p>
<p>I was going to make a video for this when I first received it, but that just never happened. But ever since Apple released <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/clips/id1212699939?at=1010l4Hj&amp;v0=www-uk-clips-app&amp;ct=chrishannah">Clips for iOS</a>, I&#8217;ve been making small videos.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYGtibWhQeg">created one for this</a>. I won&#8217;t share here what the actual details of the HyperDrive is here, because I don&#8217;t want to spoil the video!</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t get a HyperDrive from Kickstarter anymore, but they are now running an <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hyperdrive-thunderbolt-3-usb-c-hub-for-macbook-pro#/">IndieGoGO campaign</a> where you can find them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s truly a game changer for me.</p>
