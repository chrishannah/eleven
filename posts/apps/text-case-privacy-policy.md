title: Text Case - Privacy Policy
---

<p>Text Case, the iOS/macOS app, has never and currently does not collect, use, or interact with at all, any personal and private information stored on the device.</p>
<p>All data that is used in the app, is in the form of raw text that is either entered into the text field, copied from the clipboard, or shared using the Action Extension.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no need for Text Case to ever interact with anything, apart from the direct text that it is manipulating, and for that reason alone, there has never been any intention to use personal or private information.</p>
<p><em><strong>Date Effective</strong>: 10th December 2019</em></p>
