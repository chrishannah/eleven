<div class="kg-card-markdown">
<p>I’ve just finished <em>another</em> game, for <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&amp;uid=7468">Ludum Dare</a> which is a 48 hour game development competition. The idea is to start with a blank slate, and a theme, and then you have 48 hours to create everything and to create a game. The entries are then rated by other game developers and after three weeks, you get to see where you ranked.</p>
<p>My latest entry was <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&amp;uid=7468">“Kitten Killer“</a>, a game where you have to kill as many kittens as possible in 60 seconds. It may seem horrific, but the theme was “You are the monster” so I thought it was very suitable.</p>
<p>It only finished Sunday evening so I have a while left, but it’s already started to receive very positive comments.</p>
<p>You can play Kitten Killer on <a href="http://cryptix.itch.io/kitten-killer">itch.io</a>.</p>
