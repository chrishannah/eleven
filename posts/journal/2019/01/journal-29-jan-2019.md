<p>Another good day for podcast listening! I managed another three episodes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://aslabofglass.com/25"><strong>A Slab of Glass</strong> 25: Why are you Microwaving a Notebook?! (With Alex Cox)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/podcast-157-pixelumperfect/"><strong>The BirchTree Podcast</strong> 157: Pixel&#8230;Um&#8230;Perfect</a></li>
<li><a href="https://art19.com/shows/startalk-radio"><strong>StarTalk Radio</strong>: Inside The Big Bang Theory, with Simon Helberg and Bill Prady</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also got a bit more packing done, which involved dismantling my desk and poking away most of my electronics. It&#8217;s all roughly ready, so hopefully, it won&#8217;t take long to actually to move.</p>
<p>Between the various bits of preparation for the move, I also managed to fit in watching Arsenal! We played Cardiff City and beat them 2-1. Not a totally convincing result, but other top teams lost points, so it edges Arsenal just slightly back into the top four.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is going to be a big day.</p>
