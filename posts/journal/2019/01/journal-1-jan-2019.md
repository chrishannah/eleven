<p>Well it was a good day to start the new year!</p>
<p>Technically the first few hours of the year was spent at a family party, which involved alcohol, bad singing, and questionable dancing.</p>
<p>However the afternoon was filled with a trip to watch Arsenal vs Fulham at The Emirates. A much needed improvement since the last game, and we won 4-1!</p>
<p>After that it was time for a Chinese takeaway for dinner. And who could possible turn down one of those?</p>
