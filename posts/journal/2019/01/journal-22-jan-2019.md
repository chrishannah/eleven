<p>Another day at work! Nothing amazing to really shout about, but nothing to moan about either.</p>
<p>I listened to only one podcast today, <a href="https://coreint.org/2019/01/episode-357-it-was-actually-kinda-fun/">Core Intuition episode 357</a>. Itâ€™s slowly starting to become one of my must-listens, as Manton and Daniel always seem to have an interesting take on things. And it&#8217;s also good to hear developers talk about things that aren&#8217;t directly to do with programming.</p>
<p>Following on from yesterday, me and my girlfriend also made another step forward in our house purchase. I had to print out 39 pages in total, with various forms and acknowledgements to sign. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll scan them in, and we can start the final proceedings. I would do this on my iPad like most of the document signing I&#8217;ve done in the entire process. But the solicitors seem to have an issue with this, and don&#8217;t class it as being suitable. I don&#8217;t see the difference between annotating directly on an iPad, compared to printing, signing in pen, and scanning it back to PDF. But I&#8217;m not in a place where I can change anything!</p>
