<p>Today was the second day of a design sprint at work, so it was a busy day again! Fortunately, tomorrow is less intense, so I won&#8217;t be tired for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>I did manage to get one feature on Text Case “working” before I gave up doing anything work-like. I expanded the settings to included setting the title case style.</p>
<p>Throughout my commute to and from work I also slipped in a podcast. Another episode of The Stalman Podcast, and this time Marco Arment and Casey Liss were guests! I&#8217;ve started listening to an episode of The Instance (World of Warcraft podcast), but I&#8217;ll save the rest for the commute tomorrow.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the night, I&#8217;ve played a few games on my PS4. But mostly I&#8217;ve been annoying my girlfriend with my bad piano and guitar skills.</p>
