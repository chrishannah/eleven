<p>A pretty average day at work, I did some code, wrote out some ideas for future customer journeys in the app, and other stuff.</p>
<p>But outside of work, I managed to do a bit more.</p>
<p>I <a href="#">wrote/linked to a blog post from New Scientist</a>, where they were claiming that the ECG feature is actually a bad thing.</p>
<p>And I also managed to listen to three podcast episodes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#"><strong>The Tim Ferris Show</strong> 355: Greg McKeown &#8211; How to Master Essentialism</a>  </li>
<li><a href="#"><strong>Core Intuition</strong> 358: Accidental Dark Mode</a></li>
<li><a href="#"><strong>Under the Radar</strong> 157: Editorial Content</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That was helped by the fact that I spent a bit off time tonight packing up some of my things in my bedroom. Getting ready for the impending move in a few days!</p>
<p>A few things I did notice from my packing exercise:</p>
<ul>
<li>I really underestimate how many books I own. I filled up two big boxes with them, and I have a couple left over. For someone that didn’t think they owned that many, I easily have over 50. It also varies a lot, from Harry Potter to Swift development books, to even books on theoretical physics.</li>
<li>Maybe I own too many keyboards. I currently own a Cherry Windows keyboard, a <a href="#">Unicomp Spacesaver M</a>, <a href="#">Apple Extended II</a>, a Magic Keyboard for my iPad, and of course the Smart Keyboard that’s now attached to my iPad Pro.</li>
<li>I have a lot of items that have just been stored in a cupboard for quite a long time. Some of it is stuff for the new house, so mugs, glasses, board games, etc. But a big chunk of it just hasn’t been used. Maybe it’s time to get rid of a few things.</li>
</ul>
<p>I must admit, I already see a theme emerging from that small list. So I think I’ll end it prematurely. My bad memory is quite visible to me when I come across all of my belongings that I have completely forgotten about.</p>
