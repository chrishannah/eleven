<p>There’s a bit more variety today.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="2106" height="984" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6709" src="https://chrishannah.me/images/2019/01/DraggedImage-2.png" srcset="https://chrishannah.me/images/2019/01/DraggedImage-2.png 2106w, https://chrishannah.me/images/2019/01/DraggedImage-2-300x140.png 300w, https://chrishannah.me/images/2019/01/DraggedImage-2-768x359.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 2106px) 100vw, 2106px" /></p>
<p>I did something that I probably should have done a while ago, and that’s adding search to my blog. My blog runs on WordPress, so it only took adding a widget to the sidebar, and writing a small template for the results page. For some reason I’ve been putting it off. But it makes it so much easier to find old content.</p>
<p>While I was at work, I decided to start using my Apple Extended Keyboard II again. I stopped using it for a while, simply because I moved desk and I’ve been working mainly just from a laptop. But I’ve gotten used to the various different function keys for media and mission control. My current solution with the AEKII is trying out Keyboard Maestro. I have some custom macros set up for the function keys, and they’re media controls, volume, mission control, show desktop, etc. Hopefully I can make more use of it, then I’ll be purchasing a copy.</p>
<p>One section that I feel is going to become regular in these posts, is my podcast listening. I managed two episodes today:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.startalkradio.net/show/food-science-and-culture-with-anthony-bourdain/"><strong>Star Talk Radio</strong> S04 E1: Food, Science, and Culture, with Anthony Bourdain&nbsp;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://coreint.org/2019/01/episode-356-reach-for-the-stars/"><strong>Core Intuition</strong> 356: Reach For The Stars</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, I did a bit of work on Text Case 2.0 again today. I tightened up a few things from yesterday, like fixing scrolling lag (that was due to me messing around with rending shadows on every format, which gets updated every character you type), and some colour contrasts. I then started working on the Settings, where it currently only shows the theme. It actually doesn’t work right now, so you can’t even select it. But a lot of the work I did here were the foundations of how settings are stored, and actioned upon in the app. So once that is complete, the whole system is quite modular, which will be nice for future me that may have to update it.</p>
