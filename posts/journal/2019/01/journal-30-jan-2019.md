<p>Very big day, very short journal entry.</p>
<p>So today, me and my girlfriend moved into our new house!</p>

<p>We got the keys just before 2 pm, and we spent the rest of the day moving things between houses, picking up appliances, and then trying to at least get things in the correct room.</p>

<p>Of course one of my main concerns was my office because I now have a whole separate room for that! All I&#8217;ve done so far is move my desk, chair, and wired up a few things. But I want to get a lot more storage in here. I&#8217;ll probably paint it another colour as well.</p>

<p>After a long day, we finally got around to eating dinner just after midnight! I cooked the first meal in the new house, and it was a chicken stir fry!</p>
