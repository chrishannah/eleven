<p>A usual Saturday with my girlfriend.</p>
<p>We went to the cafe for breakfast, and I had the usual. Which for a while they didn&#8217;t remember, and I had to say my order.  First world problems definitely.</p>
<p>We then spent a few hours shopping for our new house (not moved in yet, but it&#8217;s ours!). We have things like saucepans, a kettle, cleaning supplies, etc.</p>
<p>I then watched some more football, as there&#8217;s a bunch more FA Cup games going on this weekend. A lot of small teams beat major teams, and while that process the <em>magic of the cup</em>, they hardly ever win by playing good football.</p>
