<p>Today was a day for a trip to Reading for a party for someone in my girlfriends family. I was reminded how bad I was at bowling, and that I seem to be the only person that has a beer at 12 pm in the afternoon.</p>
<p>It was a bit of a long day, because of the added travelling. But since we&#8217;ve been back, I&#8217;ve mainly been doing more research into the things we will need when we move our, and also some inspiration for the garden, and my future office.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of Japanese gardens, but it&#8217;s nowhere near the size needed for that, so it&#8217;s going to be interesting seeing how I can develop that.</p>
<p>And regarding the office, I&#8217;ve got a bunch of ideas on how it could be laid out, and also what types of storage I&#8217;ll need. However, I&#8217;ve basically come to the realisation that it&#8217;s probably best to postpone any purchasing until we actually move in. Because I&#8217;ll most likely want to at least paint the walls a darker colour, then I can focus on adding furniture.</p>
