<p>So apparently it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday_(date)">“Blue Monday”</a> today.</p>
<blockquote><p>Blue Monday is a name given to a day in January (typically the third Monday of the month) claimed to be the most depressing day of the year. &#8211; Wikipedia</p></blockquote>
<p>The reasoning behind it is that by this time of year, most people’s New Years resolutions are starting to fail, the weather is cold, and everyone has no money because of Christmas.</p>
<p>I wasn’t hit by this strange condition, as my day went pretty well!</p>
<p>I went to work, as usual, got some Swift development done, worked on some more customisation with the <a href="https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts">Charts framework</a> I’ve been using, had some discussions about the cool things were about to start at work, and just generally had a productive day!</p>
<p>I also listened to the latest episode of Mac Power Users (<a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/466">#466: John Gruber Returns</a>), and it was a really great episode. Three of my favourite bloggers/podcasters all talking about how they perform live shows, the background of Markdown, the Mac, and also the iPad. I always like it when there’s a podcast about blogging, by such long-lasting bloggers.</p>
<p>After work, I discovered something that I’m supposed I didn’t notice the other day. On Saturday I watched the first episode of the second series of The Punisher. I thought that was all that was released. But I forgot that it was on Netflix, and that they just give you everything in one go. So I’ve managed to watch another three episodes already. I don’t expect this series to last more than another week.</p>
<p>There’s also a tiny bit of progress about the house me and my girlfriend are buying. Nothing to write about exactly, as I want to save most of the discussion about it until it’s actually completed. That’s going to take a while longer, but it’s nearly there, and I’m going to be looking through Ikea catalogues a lot more now.</p>
