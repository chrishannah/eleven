<p>Nothing that impressive to write about today. It was a busy day at work, and afterwards I mainly played games and watched TV.</p>
<p>But I came into a problem at work today, where I couldnâ€™t add any padding easily to a UILabel in an app. So I wrote a small subclass that adds an insets variable, and made sure it still worked with AutoLayout. <a href="https://chrishannah.me/adding-insets-to-a-uilabel/">You can find that here on the blog</a>, or <a href="https://gist.github.com/chrishannah/634c476db92bdb040ba4133c82ec6bd6#file-insetlabel-swift">the code directly on GitHub</a>.</p>
