<p>Today started like any other work day, and I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have anything interesting to write up. But it turned out to be quite productive!</p>
<p>In my lunch break I added HTTPS to my main domain (<a href="https://chrishannah.me/">chrishannah.me</a>), simply because I found it so easy to add it to this blog.</p>
<p>I then spent loads of time wondering about my next project, until I posted a single tweet, that seemed to have started a huge chain-reaction inside my head.</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe the big project Iâ€™m looking for is actually Text Case 2.0. ðŸ¤” &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah/status/1082680728020766720">@chrishannah</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I then had a burst of ideas about where I could take it. About the overall design of the app, how I structure the formats, and how the efficient the user interaction is. All this while concurrently going over the current code structure in my head.</p>
<p>So when I got home from work I immediately starting working on a fresh project. Iâ€™ve so far got the main list of formats rendering, in some kind of logical sections. I can see the direction I want it to head in, and I think itâ€™s represented in this first draft, but obviously the design is super early on.</p>
<p>So take this preview with a big pinch of salt:</p>

<p>Letâ€™s see where I can take this tomorrow!</p>
