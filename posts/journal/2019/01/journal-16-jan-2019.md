<p>Back to work as usual today. The design sprint that I was part of didn’t require me at all today, so that meant I could get back to some actual development. I was starting the build the structure for a new project, so that’s pretty interesting.</p>
<p>On my blog today, I linked to a piece from John Voorhees at MacStories, about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/duckduckgo-switches-to-apple-maps-for-location-searches/%0A">DuckDuckGo now using Apple Maps for location searches</a>. I also wrote <a href="https://chrishannah.me/slacks-new-logo/">a short opinion on Slack’s new icon</a>. Not a huge essay on Medium, or any other type of insightful take on it. But <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/01/16/slack-bland-new-logo">John Gruber shared a few thoughts</a>, and they seemed to resonate with what I was also thinking, so I thought I’d say a <strong>few</strong> words as well.</p>
<p>As usual I listened to some more podcasts, and what’s even more typical, I’m ending the day with one in-progress.</p>

<p>Practically no work on Text Case today, except from I finished up the Title Case Style setting. But that took about 15 minutes.</p>
