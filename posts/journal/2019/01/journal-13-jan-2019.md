<p>It turned out I wasn’t as productive today as I thought I would be. I had planned to work on the rest of the settings in Text Case, but it simply didn’t happen!</p>
<p>Me and my girlfriend had our weekly trip to the cafe, where our drinks were brought to us before we even ordered! We were then asked if we wanted the usual, we said yes, and they were brought to us! It may be a sign we go too often, but I find it rather efficient.</p>
<p>The rest of the day has just been both of us playing games on our laptops. I played World of Warcraft while she played Sims!</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll do a bit more work tomorrow.</p>
