<p>As promised yesterday, <a href="https://chrishannah.me/starting-work-on-text-case-2-0/">I wrote a post about the current progress on Text Case 2.0</a>. I’ve done a bit more work on it today after that post as well, but it’s mostly been non visual stuff. But for the UI, I’ve added a small shadow/glow to the edge of the formats, and also changing the text colours to increase the contrast ratios.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I’ve also consumed <em>a lot</em> of media today. I watched loads of videos from <a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/SiverlinedPro">a YouTuber called Nixxiom</a> who mainly does videos about World of Warcraft, and I’m a massive nerd.</p>
<p>I also listened to a lot more podcasts than usual. It was pretty quiet at work, so I had a lot of time just working away with my headphones on. Here are the episodes:</p>
