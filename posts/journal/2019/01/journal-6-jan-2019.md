<p>Another relaxing day to mark the end of the weekend.</p>
<p>It started with me and my partner going to the local cafe for breakfast. Of course I had a full English, topped with brown sauce.</p>
<p>Between that and a obligatory Sunday roast,  it was time to play some video games! My choice as usual was World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>The day ended with us watching last years Christmas special episode of the BBC series, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0118t80">Call The Midwife</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to work tomorrow morning. I&#8217;ll hopefully be reporting back with a bit more of an interesting day.</p>
