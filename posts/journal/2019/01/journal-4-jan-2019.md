<p>As I mentioned in yesterdays journal entry, today is the day for Text Case 1.4! It’s now been released, so you can <a href="https://chrishannah.me/text-case-1-4/">view the blog post</a>, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1407730596?ls=1&amp;mt=8&amp;at=1010l4Hj">check it out on the App Store</a>. Of course I did a little <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah/status/1081109346984050688">emojified tweet</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for the update. I always find they get the most attention.</p>
<p>Apart from trying to spread the word about the update, I’ve been at work for most of the day. After which I went out for dinner with my family. Nothing special, just a pub/restaurant chain.</p>
<p>Since I got back, I’ve played two games of FIFA 19 Seasons, played some guitar, and then got stuck inside YouTube for about an hour. I even ended up watching a 10 minute video of Japanese chefs slicing things, which was actually pretty mesmerising after a while.</p>
