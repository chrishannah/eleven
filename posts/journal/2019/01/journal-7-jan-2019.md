<p>It’s Monday, so I’m back at work! Although I didn’t do anything worthwhile talking about here, as it was mainly admin tasks for our annual performance reviews.</p>
<p>However, I did get round to completing a task that I’ve been wanting to do for a while. And that was to create a new guide about connecting an Xcode project to a GitHub repository.  <a href="https://chrishannah.me/putting-your-xcode-project-on-github-the-easy-way/">The one I wrote nearly a year ago</a> has become rather outdated, as the source control features in Xcode has improved significantly. I’ve made some modifications to the guide before, but it really needed a whole refresh. So I’ve done it, and you can read my <a href="https://chrishannah.me/using-github-and-xcode-together/">“Using GitHub and Xcode Together”</a> guide now!</p>
<p>I also linked to two other posts on my blog today, the first being <a href="https://chrishannah.me/michael-rockwell-macbook-air/">a review by Michael Rockwell of the MacBook Air</a>, and the second being a very interesting take on <a href="https://chrishannah.me/why-isnt-bamboo-wood-a-bigger-worldwide-industry/">why bamboo wood isn’t a bigger industry</a>.</p>
<p>To end the day I caught up on my YouTube subscriptions, nearly everything in my RSS reader, and just a little bit of World of Warcraft. Now I just need to find one more thing to watch before I go to bed, while I still ponder what my next project will be.</p>
