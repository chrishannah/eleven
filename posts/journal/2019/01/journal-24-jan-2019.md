<p>It wasn’t work as usual today, I worked from home! So meant I was pretty productive and managed to focus on a few things.</p>
<p>It’s always weird when I work from home because I seem to forget about a lunch break. I usually go between 12:30 and 1 pm, but if I’m at home I forget about it until about 2/3pm. That’s a pretty weird metric, but it somehow proves my productivity levels. At least to myself.</p>
<p>I listened to the rest of the Talk Show from yesterday, with Joanna Stern. It wasn’t as long as they usually are either, with this one only amounting to 107 minutes.</p>
<p>Over on the blog <a href="https://chrishannah.me/previewing-json-with-quick-look/">I wrote about a Quick Look plugin for viewing JSON files</a>, it’s going to be pretty useful for me. There’s a bunch of other plugins I’m going to look into as well.</p>
<p>Also, I managed to watch the remaining episodes of The Punisher. Which means I’ve finished the entire series of 13 episodes in just 5 days. I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or not. But this series was incredible, and I hope they extend it for another!</p>
