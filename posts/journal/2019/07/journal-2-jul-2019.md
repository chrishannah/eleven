<p>I finally had a productive day at work for once! I was pairing with another developer, and we were finally left alone to actually get some work done for once. There was the odd thing I was needed for, but it was a nice change from yesterday.</p>
<p>Since finishing work, I’ve been at my girlfriends parents house. They invited us round for a BBQ and we then stayed to watch the football. Sadly USA beat England, which means I’ll be supporting The Netherlands from now on.</p>
<p>I also managed to write something on my blog today. Nothing major, just <a href="https://chrishannah.me/dark-mode-has-increased-my-appreciation-for-light-mode/">a realisation I’ve had about light and dark themed interfaces</a>.</p>
