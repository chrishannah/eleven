<p>So it was back to work after a sunny weekend.</p>
<p>Today was full of discussions and meetings. It was pretty boring to be honest. Seeing as the end result of the meetings were pretty much what we were already doing.</p>
<p>However, Arsenal did announce their home kit for the 2019/2020 season, so I made sure I bought myself a shirt. It&#8217;s a throwback to a much earlier design, and it&#8217;s been very welcomed by the fans.</p>
<p>After I got home, I went out for a coffee, done some chores in the house, and now I&#8217;m sat in the garden with the cat writing this entry!</p>
<p>I think I can fit in some World of Warcraft now before I go to bed.</p>
