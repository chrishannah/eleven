<p>Today was very much a continuation of yesterday at work, in that I was still pairing on the same piece of work, and we got quite a lot done.</p>
<p>In the most basic terms, it&#8217;s a Java Spring Boot server that has a few endpoints, and a database. I&#8217;m not exactly excited that I&#8217;m writing Java, seeing as I&#8217;m a Swift developer, but it&#8217;s something the team has been assigned to. Deadlines ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. However, I&#8217;m now properly writing tests, and I&#8217;m learning a lot of fundamental things that I take back to my Swift code.</p>
<p>In this specific piece of work, we have unit tests, integration tests, and also functional tests in the form of BDD/Gherkin scenarios. It&#8217;s interesting to see it all working together.</p>
<p>After work, I&#8217;ve mainly been doing house work. Things like washing up, laundry, and in general tidying up.</p>
<p>I did however, get a chance to look at Text Case for a bit, and I&#8217;ve started work on supporting parameters in Shortcuts actions! It will only be relatively simple, have a text input, and a text output, so hopefully I can get a build out via TestFlight soon.</p>
<p>I did notice one cool thing in iOS 13 beta 3 while I was doing this, and that&#8217;s that a bug that was introduced in the 1st beta, has now been fixed. It&#8217;s where in the custom icon select page, the icon images would expand past their bounds, and overlap nearly half the screen. I tried various ways to fix it when it first came up, but thank god the latest beta simply fixes it. That&#8217;s one less thing to think about.</p>
