<p>It was a bit of a different start to the working week today, because I was working from home. And that means, I make my own lunch fresh, coffee whenever I want it, and when I finish work, I’m already at home!</p>
<p>That meant I could do some more work in the garden while it was still sunny. I didn’t do much, just rotating some of the soil, because there are huge lumps of clay everywhere.</p>
<p>I was also in charge of cooking dinner, for me, my girlfriend, and her sister. I cooked chicken quesadillas, and they turned out pretty well.</p>
<p>After that I’ve just been relaxing in front of the television. I just finished a documentary about Barcelona F.C. called “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9135854/">Take the Ball, Pass the Ball</a>”. It’s truly fascinating.</p>
