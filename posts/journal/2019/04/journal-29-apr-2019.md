<p>I’ll start with the boring stuff: I went to work, set up my new desk in our new floor, and worked on a project. When I got home, I ate my dinner that my girlfriend made before she left for a night shift, and I watched a few videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>However, tonight was a different story. I just watched Avengers: Endgame. I’m not going to spoil anything here, but I would like to announce that I <em>finally</em> have a favourite film. I’ve always had multiple “favourites”, but this one is <strong>everything</strong>.</p>
