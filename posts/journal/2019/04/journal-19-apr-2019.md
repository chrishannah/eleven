<p>It’s the start of a bank holiday weekend!</p>
<p>It started like a typical Sunday in some ways, with mySelf and my girlfriend relaxing for a few hours with our fluffy cat.</p>
<p>It was very good weather as well, which was very beneficial, as we spent the evening with her sister and her partner. We went to an adventure golf course, called Lost Jungle London. It was a pretty fun day our!</p>
<p>After eating dinner, we spent the remainder of the day at the pub with my family. And by family, I mean an absolute huge family. My mum has five sisters and a brother, and there’s tons more kids to go with them. It was a very fun evening.</p>
