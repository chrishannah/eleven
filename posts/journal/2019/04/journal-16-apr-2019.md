<p>I woke up with a furry face next to me this morning, which was a pleasant way to start the day. Unfortunately that’s now how the day went on, as after making myself and my girlfriend coffee/tea this morning for our commutes, I put them down to shut the door, and somehow they spilled all over the floor. And then I was greeted with train problems after I got into London.</p>
<p>Luckily, my day at work was alright. So it wasn’t a totally bad day.</p>
<p>Just as I was finishing work, I had a sudden realisation about an app that I want to work on. It’s still a fragile idea, so I don’t particularly want to share details just yet. Which is why I sent out <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah/status/1118200832481218560">a pretty cryptic tweet about it earlier</a>.</p>
<p>Once I was home, I spent some time writing as much as possible about the idea. And also some form of task/feature list that is going to grow rapidly in the next few days. I’m not rushing into development though, as I want to spend a lot of time planning the project, and getting some tools ready before I start.</p>
<p>That didn’t consume my entire evening though, as I managed to watch the Barcelona vs Manchester United game (Barcelona is my second team), coupled with a pizza!</p>
<p>Right now, we’re just watching another episode of Hanna, and then it will be bed time.</p>
