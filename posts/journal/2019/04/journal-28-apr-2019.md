<p>Today started with a nice lie-in, followed by a disappointing performance by Arsenal as soon as I woke up. So nothing too great to dwell on.</p>
<p>Over on the blog, I did link to two articles today. The first being <a href="https://chrishannah.me/reeder-is-back-and-better-than-ever-%e2%86%92/">Matthew Cassinelli’s Reeder 4 review</a>, and the second being a really interesting video about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/growing-a-jungle-in-my-new-york-apartment-%e2%86%92/">how someone turned an apartment into an indoor jungle</a>. Well I thought I linked to these articles, but for some reason they apparently didn’t publish earlier. So I’ve literally hit the publish button while writing this.</p>
<p>I cooked another roast dinner, which was slightly better than before. But there are still some improvements to make. Such as broccoli with cheese sauce, and stuffing!</p>
<p>Tonight was spent playing various games. I played a tiny bit of World of Warcraft, Fifa, and No Mans Sky. I attempted to play Call of Duty and Overwatch on my PS4, but they were hidden behind huge hour long downloads. So alas, they will have to wait.</p>
