<p>It was an interesting day at work today. I was working on a new project that involves writing Java plugins for an authentication platform (I’m aware this is vague, and strange as a mobile developer, but I’m not actually sure how much I can say about my fag job), and our team made some good progress! We even had a productive meeting, which isn’t always what usually happens.</p>
<p>When I got home, I cooked chicken fajitas for me and my girlfriend. Then we watched the first two episodes of a series called Hanna, it’s a bit strange, but I’m liking it.</p>
<p>Now it’s tile to relax in bed, and get an easy night, like the apparent adults we are.</p>
