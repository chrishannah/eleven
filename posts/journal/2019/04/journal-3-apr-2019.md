title: 'Journal: 3 Apr 2019'

<p>For today’s journal entry, I could literally copy yesterday’s, and change the title. Essentially, everything I did was the same.</p>
<p>Of course, I did different things at work, and watched different YouTube videos in the evening. But it was still the same base schedule of work, dinner, YouTube, bed, with added Lost sprinkled between.</p>
<p>Although there are 122 episodes of Lost, I’ve already managed to watch 84 of them! Hopefully something else comes out soon that I can watch. Otherwise, I’ll have to complete another old tv show.</p>
