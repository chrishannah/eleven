<p>I&#8217;ll skip work in this entry, there&#8217;s really not much to say.</p>
<p>However, me being at work, and my partner also being at work, meant that our cat was at home alone for the first &#8220;large&#8221; amount of time. After I got back, it appeared he was asleep in out bedroom, and didn&#8217;t show any signs of being in distress, or actually missing us that much!</p>
<p>I cooked dinner again tonight, and it was a chicken curry with the rest of the roast chicken I made on Sunday. It was surprisingly good.</p>
<p>After dinner, me and the cat watched the Arsenal game. Well, I can&#8217;t really say that he was paying full attention, but I was. We won 1-0 away against Watford, and although the scoreline is pretty low, the 3 points is all that matters. So it was a very good night!</p>
<p>To finish the day, myself and my girlfriend are watching trash tv, and I&#8217;m also catching up on articles in my RSS reader.</p>
<p>I did take <em>a</em> photo of our cat today, but I wouldn&#8217;t exactly say it was a good one. I&#8217;ll include it just to show the problems I face when taking a photo of a fluffy black cat.</p>
