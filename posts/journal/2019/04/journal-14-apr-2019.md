<p>Today has been quite a simple and quiet day in our household.</p>
<p>Of course, we spent a lot of time with our new cat. But apart from popping to our local cafe in the afternoon, we didn’t leave the house at all. And we didn’t do much inside it either!</p>
<p>The day has been scattered with watching YouTube videos, catching on Hanna, playing games, and just not doing anything energetic</p>
<p>For dinner, I cooked our first roast dinner in our new house. It included roast chicken, roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings, vegetables, and gravy. It actually turned out pretty well, which I was very surprised with.</p>
<p>Sadly there are no photos of Jay to share in this entry. I haven’t managed to get any that are sharp, or where he’s actually looking somewhere near the camera. Maybe tomorrow.</p>
