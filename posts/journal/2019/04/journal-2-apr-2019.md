<p>Back to the average day again. I actually went into the office today, as the trains were back to normal. And then I ended up leaving late, so there wasn’t much time left in the day.</p>
<p>When I got back, I popped out for a coffee with friends. And then I’ve just been watching YouTube with my girlfriend.</p>
<p>One thing that is good from today, is that me and my girlfriend have decided that we want to get a cat. And we think we’ve found one that we like nearby that we can adopt! 🐱</p>
