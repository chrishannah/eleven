<p>Wooooo! Friday!</p>
<p>It was an <em>easy</em> day at work today. No stress involved, and a few projects/tasks got cleared up, which is a very good thing. Because of our desk/floor move at work, we had to finalise all of our packing. If all goes according to plan, all of our belongings will be next to our next desk on Monday morning.</p>
<p>I’ve been reading more of my Essentialism book, and I’m now roughly halfway through it. It’s been very interesting so far.</p>
<p>This evening I went out for a quick coffee, and I also played some world of Warcraft.</p>
<p>It’s nowhere as early as yesterday, but it’s now time for bed. I expect tomorrow will be slightly more interesting that today.</p>
