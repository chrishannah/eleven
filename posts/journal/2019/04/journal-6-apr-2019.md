<p>Do today has been kind of weird one.</p>
<p>Me and my girlfriend visited someone who may be joining the family soon. So I’ll clear that up in the near future!</p>
<p>The rest of the day was spent getting ready for one of my family parties. Yep have a big family, and we have pretty loud parties! Thai time it was my cousins thirtieth birthday, so that’s as good as a reason as any. Well, I’m still at that party as I’m writing this entry. So far I’ve been drinking (a lot), singing, and dancing.</p>
<p>I forgot to say that it was a karaoke party. So we had a real band, and then random groups of people would sing a song. Unfortunately, me and my brother sung a song with me girlfriend and aunt, but we requested our second a bit too late.</p>
<p>I still think that we were the life of the party. But them videos won’t make it to the internet.</p>
