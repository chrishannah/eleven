<p>A pretty boring day from start to finish today.</p>
<p>I was at work as usual for most of the day, I then went food shopping with my girlfriend, and most of the night I’ve been spent just doing things like sorting through email, Twitter, etc.</p>
<p>The only entertaining thing I did today was listen to the latest episode of Connected, live as it was being recorded. It was a pretty fun episode to listen to.</p>
<p>I also watched a few minutes of the Man City vs Tottenham game, unfortunately although Man City won, Tottenham still progressed to the next round, due to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Away_goals_rule">away goals rule</a>. I really wish they’d get rid of that.</p>
<p>Right now, I should be going to bed. However, what I’m actually doing (apart from writing this) is sitting in my office on my iPad, trying to find a good email app.</p>
<p>There was one other thing, I settled on a “project management” tool for the app I’m currently planning. I went with Trello in the end:</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was thinking about how I’m going to plan this app, and after considering JIRA, Todoist, Things, GitHub issues, and a few others, I’ve settled on Trello.</p>
<p>So far my lists are:<br />
&#8211; Ideas<br />
&#8211; Features<br />
&#8211; Next<br />
&#8211; Now<br />
&#8211; Done</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I chose Trello mainly because of the cards concept, and how it’s not directly related to the code. The different lists should help me manage my scope, and work better with small iterations, while also having a backlog of undeveloped ideas, and fleshed our features.</p>
