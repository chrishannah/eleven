<p>It&#8217;s one of them days, where I&#8217;ve got back from work, eaten dinner, and I just want to go to sleep. I&#8217;m exhausted!</p>
<p>It was a pretty busy day at work. It didn&#8217;t help that some people that I was dealing with, weren&#8217;t quite at the level I expect. I know that&#8217;s a bit bitchy, but I have things to get on with.</p>
<p>I did change something on the blog today as well. I removed the ad from the website, and replaced it with a &#8220;sponsor&#8221; style advert. So any sponsors will have to manually do this from my website itself, rather than being part of a network. I&#8217;ll no doubt write about this tomorrow.</p>
<p>Right now, I&#8217;m going to sleep. It&#8217;s not even 9 pm yet, but I&#8217;m just too tired.</p>
