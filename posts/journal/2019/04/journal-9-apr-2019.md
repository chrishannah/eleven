<p>I did a few things today.</p>
<p>First off I went to work, I did some work, and then I left work. I&#8217;m not doing mobile development at the moment, as our team has been tasked with a temporary project, so I can&#8217;t even talk about any cool things like that.</p>
<p>During my break, I managed to change the colour scheme of this blog. It&#8217;s not a total redesign, as you can probably tell, but I&#8217;ve switched from a white/red colour scheme, to a dark-blue/orange one. I&#8217;ve liked this colour pair for a while, and I prefer dark interfaces, so I thought it was a good idea. The idea of a theme toggle existed in my mind for a while, but I don&#8217;t want to add any unneeded complexity. I&#8217;ll just keep altering the design as my taste changes.</p>
<p>I also made some big <em>progress</em> on Lost, as I&#8217;ve now just realised that I&#8217;ve finished watching the fifth season. And I&#8217;ve actually already completed the first episode of the sixth (the final one).</p>
<p>My podcast listening wasn&#8217;t spectacular, but I did finish the latest episode of The Talk Show, and I&#8217;ve got a few great ones ready to listen to tomorrow. The Queue mechanism in Castro is really helpful to pick out the episodes I really want to listen to, so I can see me starting to listen to them more regularly again. I also appreciate that you can view your playing history, as I tend to report this in my journal, and my memory isn&#8217;t exactly great.</p>
