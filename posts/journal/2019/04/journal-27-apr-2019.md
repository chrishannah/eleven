<p>Me and my girlfriend had quite a lie in this morning, and after we got up we watched some television and I played some games on my Mac.</p>
<p>Eventually we went for lunch, which was actually a very late breakfast at our usual cafe. This was, of course, followed by a regular bit of shopping for house stuff.</p>
<p>In the early evening, I was out for a coffee, and also dinner at Wagamamas with friends.</p>
<p>While I was out, my girlfriend was watching Moana, so when I got back, I watched the rest. I also managed to convince her to watch Mighty Joe Young afterwards, as that was a film I watched loads growing up.</p>
<p>I also watched a few videos on growing indoor plants, which I really want to do. I don’t just want to grow a couple of basic plants in pots though, the videos I’ve been watching are people that have essentially, micro-forests in their house.</p>
