<p>Today has been very much just getting back into the swing of things. I had some issues this morning with the trains, so that aspect was back to normal.</p>
<p>At work, our entire team, which was formed recently for a new project, is getting to a point where we have tangible results starting to appear. I personally have been doing a mix of server-side code in Java, some theory/diagrams, various configuration stuff, and a bit of web development. I’m by no means a web developer, but I have enough skills for an MVP that we’re working on, and it’s really fun. Although, Swift development will always be my primary focus.</p>
<p>After work, I had dinner which was cooked by my girlfriend. Again, because she was starting a night shift, and would leave before I arrived back home from work.</p>
<p>So because I had a few hours with not much to do, I went out in the evening for a coffee with a friend, and honestly not much else. I listened to some podcasts, and watched a couple of videos on YouTube. But mainly I’ve been doing nothing. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>It’s now 11 pm roughly, which is the time I aim to write this entry everyday. And after it’s published, I’m going to have an <em>early<sup><a href="#fn1-12950" id="fnr1-12950" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup></em> night&#8221;.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<ol>
<li id="fn1-12950">
Well, early for me. My base bedtime is 12pm, and it usually ends up being a bit later. <a href="#fnr1-12950" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">↩︎</a></li>
</ol>
</div>
