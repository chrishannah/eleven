<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today was one of the most relaxing days I&#8217;ve had in quite some time.</p>
<p>Me and my girlfriend started the day with a little lie-in. I then made the tea/coffee, and we sat in the living room for a while.</p>
<p>After we were fully awake, my girlfriend went to read in the garden, as the weather was very nice! I watched a couple of episodes of Lost, and eventually joined her. I didn&#8217;t end up doing any reading myself, but I did catch up on over 24 hours of Twitter.</p>
<p>For lunch, she made nachos with the remainder of the chilli she made yesterday. While eating that, we discovered the &#8220;One Planet&#8221; series on Netflix. So we watched the first episode of that, which was very interesting as we expected.</p>
<p>After some more time spent hanging about the house, I cooked Mexican chicken and rice for dinner. It turned out pretty well.</p>
<p>In the evening, my girlfriend had to go to work for a night-shift. So I went out for a coffee with a friend, and since then I&#8217;ve just been playing some Fifa and World of Warcraft. I think I&#8217;ll get an episode of Lost in now, and then it will be time to go to bed!</p>
