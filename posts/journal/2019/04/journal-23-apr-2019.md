<p>I was totally not ready for today. It was an early 6:30 start, followed by an absolutely sweltering office. Hopefully the air conditioning is a bit more effective tomorrow.</p>
<p>While on my lunch break, I finished off writing <a href="https://chrishannah.me/my-experience-using-castro-as-my-primary-podcast-app/">my review of Castro</a>, and published it to the blog today.</p>
<p>I also did some reading. I used my commute to force myself to start reading Essentialism. Tomorrow will be exactly the same.</p>
<p>Tonight, me and my girlfriend have been visiting her parents house for dinner. And now itâ€™s time to go to bed and start it all over again tomorrow.</p>
