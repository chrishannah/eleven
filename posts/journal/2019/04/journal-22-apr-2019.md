<p>It’s the last day of the Easter “weekend”, and we spent that at my girlfriends sisters house. So that means we’ve visited both of our families over the break!</p>
<p>It also means that I’m back to work tomorrow, which I’m totally not ready for. Thinking of myself tomorrow, I did cook myself some lunch just now, so that’s one less thing to worry about.</p>
<p>Now I’m going to make sure I read at least the first few pages of Essentialism, as I’ve totally failed to do that so far.</p>
