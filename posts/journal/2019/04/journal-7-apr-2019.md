<p>Okay, so tonight’s entry will hopefully make slightly more sense than yesterday’s. Turns out that writing after drinking (a lot) is not a good idea.</p>
<p>Today has been spent lounging around at home, watching television, playing Fifa, and also watching the Arsenal game. Arsenal lost, but I won’t dwell on that.</p>
<p>I do have some more news about a strangely worded announcement I wrote in yesterday’s entry, and that’s our new feline companion! We’re adopting a rescue cat, and we hope to pick him up early this week. We’ve already bought the necessary supplies, got a bed ready, and even a big cat “frame” that it can use. I’ll share some pictures when we have him!</p>
