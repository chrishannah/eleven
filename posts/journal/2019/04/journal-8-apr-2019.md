<p>The first half of my day can be easily described with a quote from Rihanna:</p>
<blockquote><p>Work, work, work, work, work.</p></blockquote>
<p>After what I think was a reasonably productive workday, I&#8217;ve had an evening to myself to just relax, and watch/listen to things.</p>
<p>Of course, I watched some more Lost. I&#8217;m now on the fifth season. It&#8217;s pretty much been on most of the night.</p>
<p>I did get some time to listen to some podcasts as well, which is something I haven&#8217;t done for a while. It was kickstarted by me finally wanting to checkout Castro, a podcast app for iOS, and their Queue/triage idea helped me to pick out a few episodes that I really wanted to listen to. There was <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/162">an episode from Under The Radar</a>, where Marco and David talked about the different stages of developing a new app. The start of <a href="https://www.frogpants.com/blog/2019/4/8/the-metzen-series-part-01-open-book">what looks like to be a great interview series at Frogpants</a> between Scott Johnson and Chris Metzen. I also started listening to the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2019/04/06/ep-248">latest episode of the Talk Show</a>, that will take me a bit longer to listen to, as I can&#8217;t focus on long episodes that much anymore.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now going to watch yet another episode of Lost, and go to sleep, ready for a near identical day tomorrow!</p>
