<p>Cat day!</p>
<p>I spent the day working from home, just so me and my girlfriend could go and pick up the cat we&#8217;re adopting, Jay.</p>
<p>It was expected that he would be very shy, and take a while to explore his new home, and also that he may not eat until he&#8217;s comfortable. That was completely the opposite of what happened.</p>
<p>We took him to my home office first, as that was a place he could be without any distractions for a while. But he went straight downstairs, explored the house, and within a few minutes he was on my lap demanding affection.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a very vocal cat, and he very much likes to be stroked. So it&#8217;s gone pretty well!</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a photo of him where he his right now, sitting with me on my bed.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t managed to take a <em>good</em> still photo of him yet, as he&#8217;s a black cat (although his browns are coming through quite a lot in that photo), and he&#8217;s also pretty much always moving. Hopefully I&#8217;ll have one to share tomorrow.</p>
