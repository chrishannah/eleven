<p>Not long after the week started, it already feels like it’s about to end. It’s not only because of the bank holiday on Monday. But there’s a big office plan change at work on Friday, where I’ll be moving to a newly decorated floor. So that’s another day essentially written off!</p>
<p>During fog the various bits of travel today, I’ve been doing a mix of three things. When I had chance to sit for a long period (a huge chunk of my commute), I read more is Essentialism. When I had to walk somewhere, for example before/after trains on my commute, and also walking around the house, I’ve been listening to <a href="https://tim.blog/2019/03/28/neil-gaiman/">an episode of the Tim Ferris Show that features Neil Gaman</a>. It’s really interesting! And finally, any other time I’ve just been listening to some Avicci!</p>
<p>I did also watch the Arsenal game tonight when I got back. But we ended up losing 3-1, which is a big blow to the season, and is very annoying. But there’s no point worrying about that, I can’t fix it.</p>
<p>Now it’s time for me to ready a bit more Essentialism and go to bed.</p>
