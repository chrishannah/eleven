<p>I was a bit lazy today. Somehow I managed to sleep through my seemingly silent alarms. It wasnâ€™t a disaster though, as my work are kind enough to let me work from home on these occasions.</p>
<p>It means I lost out on some of the real-life interactions at work, talking to people on my team more about problems, and just general benefits from being near the people you work with.</p>
<p>That doesnâ€™t mean it was all bad, working at home. It meant that I could actually make myself a cooked lunch, and then when the work day finished, I was already at home. Thereâ€™s also the monetary benefit, because I didnâ€™t have to buy a train ticket.</p>
<p>After work, I linked to a great tip by Jeff Perry at Rocket Panda, about an <a href="https://chrishannah.me/the-escape-key-on-ipad/">alternative escape key on the iPad</a>.</p>
<p>At home, we had quite a busy evening as well. We made dinner for my girlfriends sister, and her girlfriend. We were then greeted by my parents, who also came over for a few hours.</p>
<p>It was a bit crazy, but we had a cat that people were giving a fuss to, and the football which myself and my dad were watching. It was, of course, Arsenal. We played away against Napoli, and we won! With a beautiful free kick from Lacazette. ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·</p>
<p>Now itâ€™s time to unwind before a long bank holiday weekend.</p>
