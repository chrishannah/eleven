<p>I had a pretty good day at work today. We’ve started to use TDD for a new project, and I’m really enjoying it. Testing was never something I really liked to be honest, but I’ve got into a good flow with it. And I can already see the code quality benefits, and it’s pretty motivating to slowly see the number of tests increase.</p>
<p>While in my lunch break, I took the remaining screenshots needed for <a href="https://chrishannah.me/ten-days-with-a-nintendo-switch-and-pokemon-lets-go-pikachu/">my Nintendo Switch/Pokémon review</a>, and then published it! It’s one of my longest pieces of writing, and I’m pretty pleased with it. I certainly spent a lot of time on it.</p>
<p>I also ended up emailing Apple about the affiliate program. As back last year, they announced that the app affiliate program was ending, and <a href="https://chrishannah.me/some-information-on-the-itunes-affiliate-program-payment-threshold/">I had a question about how they would handle the minimum threshold for releasing payments</a>.</p>
<p>The issue stems from the way earnings are paid. They’re all into the currencies they were earned in, and the amount had to be over a certain threshold (£20 for me) to be paid. But I argued that since the thresholds would never be met, some earnings would be stuck. They reassured me that the threshold would be removed, and payments would be made in mid-December. I’ve had around 5 currencies paid out to me that were below the threshold, so I can tell <em>something</em> is happening. But I’ve still got money left, and I’ve heard that a lot of other people are having the same issue. So I’ve got in contact with them again, to see if they can finally clear it up.</p>
