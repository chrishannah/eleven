<p>So today started with me watching about four episodes of Lost, while playing endless more hours of Pok√©mon on my Nintendo Switch!</p>
<p>After a few hours, me and my girlfriend finally built her wardrobe. It&#8217;s not complicated, but it&#8217;s absolutely huge, and it requires two sets of hands to hold things in place.</p>
<p>The wardrobe, along with watching a few YouTube videos, took us to about 8 pm. So we decided to go out for dinner, instead of starting to make something. We went to an average chain restaurant. It wasn&#8217;t great, but I guess it&#8217;s easier than cooking dinner ourselves.</p>
<p>We ended the day watching old school videos of ourselves. As we&#8217;ve found a lot of old content on YouTube of the time we were both at school together.</p>
