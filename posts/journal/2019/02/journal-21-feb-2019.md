<p>Work, work, work&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DH0BHW5Il-k/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The only thing I’ve done after work, is to get my Nintendo Switch/Pokémon review nearer to being published. I added some extra details that I thought of throughout the day, and then I started the editing process. I did start this the other day using Markup on iOS, but this time I used the GoodNotes app, and it was a delight. I then made the changes, and read the whole piece again.</p>
<p>What’s left now is just the images. I need to get a header image, and also screenshots from the Switch. This wont take long, but it’s too late for me to do it tonight. So tomorrow will be the day of publishing!</p>
<p>After it’s been published, I can get back to Text Case development!</p>
