<p>Nothing really interesting at work today, apart from working on a release build for an app. So I&#8217;ll skip over the first half of the day for this entry.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been productive in a few areas today outside of work. I wrote another few hundred words for the Nintendo Switch/Pokemon review I&#8217;m working on, and I worked on Text Case some more!</p>
<p>I honestly thought I would have been finishing off the review tonight, but as I started writing the piece, I realised it was a bit bigger than I first thought. That&#8217;s good though, because I have a lot to talk about!</p>
<p>In the mean time, I did switch back to iA Writer. I&#8217;ve been using Ulysses for the past few years, and it&#8217;s served me well, but there&#8217;s a lot of benefits to iA Writer. So expect a short article on that soon as well.</p>

<p>With Text Case, I finally got around to doing a bit of work on the redesign. When I first completed the draft of the redesign I wanted more colours, so I gave every format a gradient background, and had a specific colour for each section. It always felt half-finished though, and I worked out what the issue was. It was hard to read the formatted text, and it just didn&#8217;t look as professional anymore.</p>
<p>I countered this by making the bottom portion of the format be more like the textfield colour, and the text colour to match. It resulted in an instantly recognisable upgrade, I think it&#8217;s much better with this slight change. And it makes the results completely readable, which is hard to get when mixing various colours with black text.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve uploaded a build to Apple/TestFlight, and it&#8217;s currently waiting to be reviewed before it can be released to everyone. But feel free to <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/BjxTFv0S">sign up to to the beta</a>, and be one of the first users to ever see the 2.0 redesign!</p>
