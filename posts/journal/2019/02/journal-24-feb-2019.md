<p>Today started with me waking up at around noon. I honestly have no idea how I slept in that late. I must have had about 10 hours.</p>
<p>After I finally woke up, I made a beacon and cheese omelette for &#8220;breakfast&#8221;, and watched some Lost!</p>
<p>Then, at 4 pm, it was time for the most important part of the day. Arsenal were playing Southampton! It was a very impressive game, and we ended up winning 2-0. Which really doesn&#8217;t show how much Arsenal were dominating. On a good day, it could have been 5-0 or higher.</p>
<p>After that, me and my girlfriend got around to stripping the rest of the wallpaper from a room in our living room. Next, we&#8217;ll have to sand it down to make it smooth, fill in any holes, and decorate it!</p>
<p>After that, we both didn&#8217;t do much. We watched the latest episode of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0118t80">Call the Midwife</a>, which I&#8217;m just as interested as my girlfriend is. And then I&#8217;ve just made myself lunch for tomorrow. I&#8217;m having spaghetti carbonara!</p>
