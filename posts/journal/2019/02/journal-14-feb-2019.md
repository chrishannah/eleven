<p>So it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt3bBGBn5RU/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=11vkc99yx1ddn">Valentine&#8217;s Day</a> today! However, mine didn&#8217;t go the same as most other people. I worked the usual time, and my girlfriend is on a night shift tonight, so we didn&#8217;t actually spend any time together at all. I got back mere minutes after she left! However, when I got back to our house, I was greeted by one of her amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah/status/1096128639454887937">cheesecakes</a>!</p>
<p>Apart from eating that, I didn&#8217;t the usual work and Nintendo Switch playing. But I also watched Arsenal okay BATE Borisov, and unfortunately we lost 1-0. It wasn&#8217;t a great team selection or performance, and I&#8217;m starting to already question our new manager. It&#8217;s certainly not the situation I expected Arsenal football club to be in.</p>
