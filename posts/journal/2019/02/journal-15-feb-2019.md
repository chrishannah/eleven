<p>It‚Äôs finally the end of the week! And fortunately, it means that the training course I was on at work is finished. It was about iterative delivery, and how to vertically slice projects, so you can produce deliverables in a shorter period of time, and a lot of other things. It was beneficial, but I‚Äôd much rather spend my time writing code.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve been going through a big rewrite of one of our apps, and we finally got to a point where a build has been accepted by Apple. It turns out that‚Äôs not the build we will be releasing, as there are a few extra tweaks needed. But my boss thought it was something worth celebrating, so he purchased a bottle of spiced rum (70% alcohol content ü§Ø) for any celebratory events, as our team are known as the ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsair">Corsairs</a>‚Äù (long story, but we even have a pirate flag). It certainly warmed my body for a while.</p>

<p>As I was leaving work, I noticed the buildings on the other side of the river (Thames) were looking rather intriguing, it was if HDR was being applied in real-life. The sky was a bright<em>ish</em> blue, with the street lamps bright, and light still reflecting off the glass buildings. It‚Äôs not a great photo, as I took as I was walking out of the door, but I can‚Äôt change that now.</p>
<p>Tonight, I ate some more of the cheesecake that my girlfriend made me for Valentine‚Äôs day. It‚Äôs <strong>amazing</strong>. And fortunately, it‚Äôs going to last for quite a while.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I‚Äôve started to rewatch Lost, as it‚Äôs now on Amazon Prime Video! But at the same time as that, I‚Äôve also been keeping up with my Pok√©mon game on the Nintendo Switch. Hopefully, I‚Äôll spend some time to write about it at the weekend, but I‚Äôm really enjoying the game and the console as a whole.</p>
