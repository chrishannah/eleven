<p>Nothing too not worthy at work today, I wrote some more tests, investigated some bugs, and wrote some code. A pretty basic day.</p>
<p>After work me and my girlfriend had some of her family around, so we cooked dinner for everyone, and spent the evening watching Netflix and talking.</p>

<p>I also <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah/status/1093815618099384320">shared a quick tip on Twitter</a> earlier about using the <code>Error</code> protocol in Swift, and making it provide the correct value for <code>localizedDescription</code>.</p>
