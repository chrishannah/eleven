<p>I played around with Continuous Integration at work today. It was quite fun, and as I was writing about it in this entry, <a href="https://chrishannah.me/having-some-fun-with-continuous-integration/">it became its own article</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from work fun, I managed to get another few-hundred words written for my Nintendo Switch/Pok√©mon review. It&#8217;s much slower than I planned, but <em>oh well</em>! It&#8217;s going to be <strong>big</strong>!</p>
<p>Something good that I can announce today is that Text Case 2.0 has finally entered an open beta! I thought I&#8217;d end up writing here about it waiting to be reviewed still, but just around an hour ago it was accepted. You can <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/BjxTFv0S">find the build on TestFlight</a>.</p>
