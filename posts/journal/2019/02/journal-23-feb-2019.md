<p>Finally, a day with good weather! There was a clear sky, the sun was out, and it was even a bit warm.</p>
<p>I took the chance to install a little bird feeder in our garden. It’s basically a vertical pole, with a few different attachments on it. And so far I haven’t actually seen any birds eating anything yet, but I wouldn’t say our garden is exactly attractive to animals. As it’s literally just a lawn of grass with a bird feeder. Not one bush. And the neighbours are similar.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I’ve done a few chores. While the sun was out, I went and posted some mail. Then I done the more boring tasks, like cleaning, laundry, etc.</p>
<p>It wasn’t all boring though, as I managed to fit in quite a few episodes of Lost, and some World of Warcraft!</p>
<p>I’ve now started to watch a film called Life, on Netflix. I’ve been waiting for it to be available for a while, and although I’ve only seen half of it so far, it’s certainly not what I expected it to be. It sounded like a peaceful film about emerging life, but it definitely isn’t!</p>
