<p>It snowed quite a lot in the night, so that means another day of working from home!</p>
<p>I made full use of my office today, and simply by being in the room for a long period of time, I have some ideas of what I want to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce another colour other than white to the walls.</li>
<li>I want places to hang my many backpacks on the wall.</li>
<li>I have a lot of little ornaments and gadgets, so a mini bookcase/shelving unit would be helpful.</li>
<li>Either curtains or blinds, because right now there’s nothing in front of the window.</li>
</ul>
<p>For dinner I made another traditional Italian carbonara, which I think I’m getting the hang of!</p>
