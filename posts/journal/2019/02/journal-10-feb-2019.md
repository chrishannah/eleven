<p>After moving into our house just over 10 days ago, me and my girlfriend finally had a day of peace. No big shopping, no huge crowd of people visiting, no furniture to pick up.</p>
<p>It started with a trip to our usual Cafe for breakfast. They had put drinks ready minutes after we sat down, and they only came to us to confirm our usual order. Pretty handy!</p>
<p>After that, we did a tiny bit of shopping. A toilet seat, some wallpaper, some decorations, and other small things.</p>
<p>For dinner, I cooked Spaghetti Carbonara. Not the Italian version, it was a “British Carbonara” that&#8217;s much more creamy. And in my opinion, not as good as the original.</p>
<p>Then tonight we watched a 2007 film called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/">The Bucket List</a>. It had Morgan Freeman in it, so I was instantly interested, and it turned out to be a really funny and enjoyable film!</p>
