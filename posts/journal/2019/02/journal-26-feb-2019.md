<p>I had possibly the most unentertaining day today. It wasn&#8217;t <em>bad</em> in anyway. But, there&#8217;s only so many ways you can write &#8220;I went to work and did the same thing I did yesterday, and the day before that&#8230;&#8221;.</p>
<p>As you may have already guessed, I went to work today. I did work stuff, and when I finished the stuff, I left.</p>
<p>Apart from work, I went back to my parents house for dinner, went out for a coffee with friends, and I&#8217;ve been playing World of Warcraft since.</p>
<p>Maybe tomorrow will be a bit more interesting. Maybe not.</p>
