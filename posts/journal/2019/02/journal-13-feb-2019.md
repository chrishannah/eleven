<p>A similar day to yesterday, it involved mainly work and playing on my new Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t that boring at work though, as I was trying out BDD tests in an iOS app! Took some investigation, and a bit of patience from myself, but I now have working UI tests running from a Gherkin format <code>.feature</code> file. There was a lot of different BDD options to go for, but I didn&#8217;t feel like any of them really stood out. The main differences I saw were the level of Gherkin syntax, and the ease of writing the actual implementation of the steps. <a href="https://github.com/Ahmed-Ali/Cucumberish">Cucumberish</a>, the one I&#8217;m working with at the moment, seems to be on the side of practically perfect Gherkin syntax, but ugly implementation.</p>
<p>Apart from that, like I said at the start of this entry, I&#8217;ve been playing Pokémon: Let&#8217;s Go, Pikachu a ton. After two days, I have the first two badges, seen 49 different Pokémon, and caught 29. And if you count duplicates, then I&#8217;ve already caught 62!</p>
