<p>A busy (and hot) day at work today! I’m working on a lot of “utility” stuff in a new app. Things like caching data, saving data to the Keychain, encrypting/decrypting data, and doing this all in TDD. So my testing skills were getting a good workout.</p>
<p>I feel like this shouldn’t be included anymore, as I do it every day, but I watched a few more episodes of Lost again! I’m now halfway through episode 23 in Series 1, so that leaves me with list two and a half episodes left. I forgot how many episodes there were!</p>
<p>That wasn’t everything I did while looking at a screen though, as I got an email from the iTunes Affiliate Program team, about the minimum payment threshold. <a href="https://chrishannah.me/further-information-on-the-itunes-affiliate-program-payment-threshold/">I shared this on my blog</a>, I now consider the case closed. There’s not much else I can do or find out about this anymore.</p>
