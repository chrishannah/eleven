<p>A very good day today!</p>
<p>I don’t need up working from home, so that’s a bonus. I was working on the networking layer of an app, and at the same time trying to make everything flexible enough so it can be properly tested.</p>
<p>And after work I headed into London to watch the Arsenal game! It was a complete domination, and we beat Bournemouth 5-1! One of the beat games I’ve been to at The Emirates.</p>
<p>Hopefully I’ll get to go to a few more games before the end of the season.</p>
