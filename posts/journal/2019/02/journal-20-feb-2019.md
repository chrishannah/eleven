<p>Back to the standard “nothing to say about work” introduction. I mainly continued the work on continuous integration, and also sorting an app release out.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was spent on the Nintendo Switch/Pokémon review. I wrote about 1700 words for the first draft, and I’m now on the step of editing it. I’m doing that on my iPad, combined with the native Markup feature and my Apple Pencil. It’s a pleasant experience!</p>
<p>There’s not much else left to do after it’s passed my “editorial process”, only some text formatting (with Text Case of course), adding any relevant links, and then capturing some screenshots from the game to include.</p>
<p>Then I’ll hit the publish button!</p>
