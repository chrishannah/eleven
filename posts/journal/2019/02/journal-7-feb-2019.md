<p>So today at work was spent creating the base bones of a new iOS app. Starting with TDD and MVVM in mode, I made a basic structure, along with starting to write tests and code for the API interaction.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get that much time to do a<br />
lot of work on Text Case, apart from making a few tweaks to the Action Extension, and also some changes to the Hashtags format. I fixed a few things that could have caused weird results, so I&#8217;ve made it so you should never get multiple # together, and also that every hashtag is separated by only one space. If words are separated by other things such as a comma or full stop, they will be converted to spaces.</p>
<p>Tonight at home, me and my girlfriend ordered a pizza as there were a lot of people coming to visit. My girlfriends friend came round, followed by both of our parents coincidentally coming round at the same time.</p>
<p>And in the mean time, I built a new sofa! I don&#8217;t have a picture right now, as I&#8217;m just about to go to bed. But I&#8217;ll most likely share one at some joint tomorrow!</p>
