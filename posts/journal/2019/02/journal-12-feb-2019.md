<p>A relatively short entry today. As it wasn&#8217;t varied at all.</p>
<p>I spent the first two thirds of my day at work, where I was focusing on getting a release build ready for one of our apps.</p>

<p>While I was at work, my Nintendo Switch arrived. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing for the rest of the day. I got the Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu edition, and it&#8217;s amazing. Every part of it is styled perfectly, and I&#8217;m enjoying the game. I want to go into much more detail, but that&#8217;s going to be a separate post when I&#8217;ve played it a bit more.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I haven&#8217;t done anything today! I&#8217;m sure you can now see why it&#8217;s a short entry.</p>
