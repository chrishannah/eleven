<p>Today I went for a trip to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipsnade_Zoo">Whipsnade Zoo</a>, the largest in the UK, and one that&#8217;s only a 15-minute drive from my house. It was a very cold and windy day, so as you&#8217;d expect, most of the animals were inside, and not particularly that active. I didn&#8217;t pay for entry though, as I had some free tickets that would expire at the end of this month, so I had to use them.</p>
<p>The best animals we saw was the African Hunting Dogs. They make some unusually high-pitch squeaks, and we made it just in time to see them tear apart from what I heard was a leg of an Antelope. If you want to experience that for yourself, <a href="https://youtu.be/711v2ANilsw">I&#8217;ve put a  two-minute video of it on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>After that, my family came round my house for a drink, and we somehow ended up watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2.</p>
<p>I then cooked some Teriyaki flavoured chicken and rice for dinner, and me and my girlfriend ended up watching the second half of The Social Network. I&#8217;m not a fan of Facebook now, but the early days portrayed in the movie seemed pretty cool!</p>
