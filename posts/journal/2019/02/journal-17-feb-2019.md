<p>It&#8217;s been a relatively quite day today. The majority of it was spent lounging round the house. I made omelettes for breakfast, we then watched TV, and I played a bit of Pokémon on the Switch (of course).</p>
<p>After that we went into town to get a few things for the house, and on the way back home, we popped into my parents house to collect a few things. Obviously I was made to make the coffee and tea for everyone.</p>
<p>Then for dinner we had a pasta bake, which took nearly double the expected time, as it appears our oven is wildly inaccurate. I&#8217;ll have to do some research to see if we have anything set wrong, because I don&#8217;t want to buy an oven.</p>
<p>Apart from the boring day activities, I also started actually writing a piece in the Nintendo Switch and the latest Pokémon game. Over the past few days I&#8217;ve been noting down things as I played the game, and from that I worked out a rough outline of what I&#8217;m going to write about. And I think I should have it published Monday, or possibly Tuesday if time gets the best of me.</p>
