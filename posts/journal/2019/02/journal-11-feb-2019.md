<p>A relatively uninteresting day at work today! I continued slow progress on a new project. It involved me researching more about the MVVM pattern, and also creating more unit tests.</p>
<p>I thankfully got around to listen to some podcast episodes as well today. I haven’t been very good at keeping up with my long queue recently, but I managed an episode of <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/80">Cortex</a> and <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/229">Connected</a>.</p>
<p>Something that really interested me today, was a big list of shows that the BBC are producing. There’s at least 8 (well, the ones I care about) great shows that have been announced. I<a href="https://chrishannah.me/bbc-earth-announce-8-new-tv-nature-documentaries/"> shared this on my blog, along with a short description of each, and links to the original press releases</a>.</p>
<p><em>One more thing</em>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah/status/1095010220596776961">I made a purchase today</a>. A Nintendo Switch! To be exact, the Nintendo Switch Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! Edition Pack. The entire console, case, and JoyCons are Pikachu themed, and it comes bundled with the game! It’s arriving tomorrow, so from then I assume I’ll be obsessed with it.</p>
