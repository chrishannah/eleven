<p>I had a very exciting day at work. As I released an app! Okay, well it was an update. But it was a complete rebuild of a very stable app, and only myself worked on it. So it was a big deal for me at least.</p>
<p>So, because of that, I spent the majority of my day staring at the app analytics, and monitoring how the app was going. It was getting some interaction within the first few hours, and it&#8217;s looking positive, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll know more after the app is updated on people&#8217;s phones.</p>
<p>At home, I also did a tiny bit of development on Text Case. I added a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">Rot13</a> format, which is something that was requested a while ago, but I wanted to postpone it as one of the extra features in the 2.0 release.</p>
<p>Regarding Text Case 2.0, here&#8217;s basically what&#8217;s new/changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s been completely rebuilt from scratch (Not exactly appealing to users)</li>
<li>Complete redesign, which adds some further structure to the app using sections, and also changes the approach from a simple functional utility, to what I think is a great and rich app.</li>
<li>Three new formats: Base 64 Encode, Decode, and Rot13.</li>
<li>One-tap copy. Previously this required a long press to open a contextual menu, and a copy button would appear..</li>
<li>Much better &#8220;dialogs&#8221; in the app. For example a small bubble appears from the bottom temporarily after you&#8217;ve copied a text. It shows the format used, and the result of the format.</li>
<li>Themes! There&#8217;s now a light and dark mode, so if iOS 13 adds a dark mode it&#8217;s ready.</li>
</ul>
<p>It still feels a bit bare to me. As it&#8217;s a 2.0, I want it to actually feel like it. I haven&#8217;t got many other things on my mind at the moment, but I do know that I want to add custom app icons. That&#8217;s something I think people will enjoy. I&#8217;ve had the idea of a &#8220;text to emoji&#8221; format in my task manager for a while, that I may add as well, but I&#8217;m not 100% sure yet.</p>
