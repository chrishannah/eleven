<p>Today started with a pretty good discovery in our house. Our garden has loose stones at the bottom near the door, and we’ve wanted to replace it with a patio ever since we saw the house. But after being in the garden this morning, I noticed that there’s actually a patio underneath! It’s not complete, as there are some gaps, and it’s not perfectly flat. But it may save us a bit of work, and also it’s a lot better to have a reasonably okay patio in the short-term.</p>
<p>We both then went to town for more home-related things. And also to have lunch in our usual cafe.</p>
<p>After town, we walked my girlfriends parents dog that stayed at our house overnight, and we’ve been relaxing with Netflix and TV ever since! Well I’m especially relaxed, as I keep falling asleep on the sofa.</p>
