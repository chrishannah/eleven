<p>It was my first day back at work after my trip to Norway, and thank god it wasn&#8217;t stressful!</p>
<p>Of course, just before I finished work, I started to watch the Apple Event. I had to continue it on the commute home, with sporadic pauses because of my train going through tunnels, but I got there in the end.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to write too much about the event, but overall I liked it. News and Apple tv look like something I&#8217;d enjoy, I&#8217;ll have to wait for Apple Arcade before I make a judgment on that, and I don&#8217;t particularly care about the Apple Card. The Card is the thing I have the strongest opinions of, and it&#8217;s the thing I like the least. I&#8217;m not a fan of credit cards at all, and there&#8217;s nothing that Apple can do to get me on board. However, I&#8217;m not even eligible for it (UK), so I&#8217;m not going to waste anymore of my time worrying about it.</p>
<p>One thing I published on the blog today, was <a href="https://chrishannah.me/what-is-title-case/">a guide about Title Case</a>, including what it is, the popular formats, and also how you can select one in Text Case. I&#8217;ll have one tomorrow as well, so keep your eyes peeled!</p>
