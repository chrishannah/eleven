<p>A pretty mixed day today.</p>
<p>It stated at work with the usual stuff going on. Nothing especially good or bad.</p>
<p>After work, I had loads of trouble with my commute home. Specifically the train from London Euston. There was trespassers on the track, so every train to and from the station was cancelled. It took an hour an a half of waiting for any trains to start service.</p>
<p>Oh and then Arsenal lost 3-1.</p>
<p>But after that, my girlfriend made dinner, and I’ve been watching Lost! So there’s been both ups and downs.</p>
