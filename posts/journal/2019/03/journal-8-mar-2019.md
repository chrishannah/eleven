<p>Itâ€™s finally Friday.</p>
<p>I had a pretty busy day at work, which I actually prefer. But now I really do need a good sleep!</p>
<p>The only other thing Iâ€™ve done since getting home is cooking/eating dinner, and then sitting on the sofa falling asleep with my girlfriends parents dog, thatâ€™s staying round our house tonight.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m glad it was a rather simple day, because anything else and I wouldnâ€™t have the energy to write this journal entry.</p>
