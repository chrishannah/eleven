<p>The day was started with another bowl of cereal, and a trip to the same coffee shop. And we continued our exploration around Oslo by foot.</p>

<p>We found the Nobel Peace Centre, which was very interesting! Especially the current exhibition about the fight against sexual violence as as a weapon of war. That was very eye-opening.</p>
<p>We walked some more around the harbour, but it was super cold for a change (it’s actually been pretty sunny and warm in Oslo the past few days), so we found a pizza restaurant for lunch. It was okay, but as usual, super expensive.</p>
<p>We also went into the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art, and that was place was absolutely crazy. It was all contemporary art, or as I like to call it, “Art”.</p>
<p>For dinner we went to Nordvegan, and I had a “Buddha bowl”, which was very filling. So that’s yet another vegan meal that I haven’t managed to finish yet!</p>
<p>After some more walking, we finally headed back to the room to watch Thor: Ragnarok. And now I’ll have to get some of my stuff together, as we’re leaving tomorrow morning.</p>
