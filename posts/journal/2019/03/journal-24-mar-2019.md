<p>So what I thought would be a quiet day in, actually turned into something a bit more active than I expected.</p>
<p>It started well, as I spend a few hours watching Lost, and playing Fifa.</p>
<p>However my mum asked if I could clean out a few of my last things from my old bedroom, as sheâ€™s getting some kind of work done (I canâ€™t quite remember exactly). So I popped over, and organised that.</p>
<p>While I was at my parents house, I saw their garden fork and shovel, which made me remember that I needed to do work in my own garden. Needless to say, I borrowed the fork and shovel.</p>
<p>I then spent a while trying to clear my garden. This involved mainly digging up paving slabs, and other bits of random rock.</p>
<p>The previous owner clearly didnâ€™t do any kind of work in the garden. I e have a partial patio thatâ€™s been covered in stones, and what seemed to be a small leading into the garden, was actually two paving slabs, on top of a layer of grass, with a hidden concrete layer below it.</p>
<p>We originally suspected a draining issue in the soilÂ due the amount of moss growing in certain areas. But it seems that this issue was caused by hidden slabs under a small layer of soil, and also a huge section of the soil actually being clay.</p>
<p>I have certainly got a job ahead of me. ðŸ˜¬</p>
<p>After my garden activities, I cooked a chicken curry for dinner, and then Iâ€™ve been relaxing as much as I can before going back to work tomorrow. Of course I had to clean the dishes, and sort out my bag for work, but at least I got a few more episodes of Lost in.</p>
