<p>I was doing some interesting things at work today! We&#8217;re about to start a web project in Java, so I&#8217;ve been investigating loads of things about the frameworks we&#8217;re going to use. I&#8217;m finding it really fun!</p>
<p>After work I made a lot of progress to Text Case. I added in a text to Emoji format, that attempts to parse any words as emoji, and also does it&#8217;s best to randomise them if multiple options are available. I also finished up the rest of the app, so I fixed a few issues with the icon, fixed an issue with text-wrapping in the app, and then some more optimisations.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a possibility that something else is added/fixed in the next few days (not a very high one though). But otherwise, I have the final build of Text Case 2.0, and I&#8217;m just about to try to work on the release process.</p>
<p>One thing I have to mention, is <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah/status/1105780628505669638">my little tweet storm earlier about Spotify taking Apple to court</a>. That was fun.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t as fun as the series I started watching tonight though! Me and my girlfriend started watching Ricky Gervais&#8217; new series, After Life, on Netflix. It&#8217;s really great, and we watched three episodes back to back.</p>
<p>I shared just the one thing on the blog today, and that was <a href="https://chrishannah.me/twitter-announces-new-gesture-to-open-camera/">an announcement from Twitter about the changes to the camera in the iOS app</a>. Since then, <a href="https://twitter.com/cyanhex">Sean Thompson</a>, a product designer at Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/cyanhex/status/1105911242068234240">shared some more of the thinking behind the changes, and also some previews</a>.</p>
