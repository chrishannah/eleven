<p>I&#8217;ve had quite a busy day today! Along side my day job, I&#8217;ve got a lot of other stuff done.</p>
<p>It started with me sending <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah/status/1107621693374103553">a quick reply to Tim Cook&#8217;s tweet with him using the new iPad</a>. That tweet somehow got popular, and starting blowing up my notifications. I also <a href="https://chrishannah.me/the-ipad-mini-remains-an-important-part-of-apples-lineup/">linked to the new iPads from my blog</a>, with what I think is a pretty good headline.</p>
<p>I also made some big progress on the<a href="https://twitter.com/TextCaseApp/status/1107663934897696768"> Text Case 2.0 release</a>! It&#8217;s been officially submitted to Apple, and I&#8217;m aiming for a release this Friday (22nd). That all meant I had to prepare all the screenshots, content for the website, and the announcement post that will go on my blog. I then informed some websites/writers about the upcoming release, and hopefully they&#8217;re excited as I am!</p>
<p>Just about everything is ready to go, and that&#8217;s definitely a good idea, as I&#8217;m actually going to be in Oslo, Norway, on release day! That should be fun!</p>
<p>It also means that the journal entries should contain loads of photos soon. I&#8217;m out there from Wednesday to Saturday.</p>
