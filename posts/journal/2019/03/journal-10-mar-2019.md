<p>Today started with a mix of house work, watching television, and just relaxing around the house.</p>
<p>But it was the late afternoon that it got interesting. As it was time for Arsenal vs Manchester United! I had it on my big TV for once, and wow it was a good game. We won 2:0, and it&#8217;s a massive result for us. Naturally, that meant nothing could ruin the rest of the day.</p>
<p>When it was finished, I made myself a carbonara for dinner, and then I continued to watch more coverage of the game, and what the pundits thought of everything.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t all relaxing and football, as I got around to checking another thing of the Text Case 2.0 list. Specifically, the ability to set a custom icon! And I didn&#8217;t just add a few. In total, there are now 22 different icons to choose from.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had Lost on in the background while working on the app, and I think I can manage another episode before it&#8217;s time to go to bed!</p>
