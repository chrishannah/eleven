<p>It&#8217;s only Tuesday, and it&#8217;s already the end of my working week! That&#8217;s because in just over 8 hours, I will be flying to Oslo, Norway. And I&#8217;ll be there for 4 days!</p>
<p>That meant after work, the only thing I&#8217;ve been doing is getting ready for the trip. So, packing my clothes, charging my devices, downloading movies and books, etc. It&#8217;s all basically done, but some things will be left to charge while I have a little sleep.</p>
<p>Emphasis on the little as well, as I&#8217;m being picked up at 4 am tomorrow morning. So although I&#8217;ll try to go to sleep relatively soon, the best possible scenario is that I&#8217;m asleep by 10:30 pm, and awake as late as 3:30 am. So a maximum of 5 hours sleep, and I&#8217;m being generous to myself. I guess that means I&#8217;ll be sleeping on the plane.</p>
