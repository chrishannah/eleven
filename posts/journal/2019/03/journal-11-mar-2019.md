<p>The daily grind started again. But luckily it wasn&#8217;t exactly a stressful day at work, so I can ease into the week a bit easier.</p>
<p>One thing I did do today, was share a few things on my blog. I linked to <a href="https://chrishannah.me/jeffsum/">a pretty funny tool called Jeffsum</a>, which is like Lorem Ipsum, but with Jeff Goldblum.</p>
<p>I also wrote <a href="https://chrishannah.me/a-first-look-at-harry-potter-wizards-unite/">a piece about the latest news on Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</a>. It&#8217;s by no means a full review, and that would be weird anyway, as the game isn&#8217;t released. But, it&#8217;s a type of post that I used to do all the time when I had a blog called App Recap. I used to write massive reviews of apps, games, and general Apple news, and sadly that has dropped off over the years. But I want to get back into writing bigger pieces, and in general reviewing cool things that I think others will enjoy. I&#8217;ll steer clear of topics that will be covered in high quantitiesÂ elsewhere, because sometimes there&#8217;s not much more else I can add, but expect a bit more content on my blog soon!</p>
