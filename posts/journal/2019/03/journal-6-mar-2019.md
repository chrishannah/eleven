<p>Today at work was very much a continuation of what I was doing yesterday. I was monitoring the latest app release, while also doing a bit of work on UI testing something else!</p>
<p>Apart from work, my day hasn’t exactly been that much more interesting. I got home, ate dinner, did the usual mindless activities on my phone (Twitter, Instagram), caught up with my RSS reader, and then watched a film with my girlfriend!</p>
<p>Maybe the film should be classed as interesting. But it was something I’ve seen before. The problem was, I was enjoying the beginning as I forgot most of the storyline, but after about a quarter of the way though, my mind had already remembered the rest. So I couldn’t exactly stay focussed.</p>
