<p>Today was a tiny bit more exciting than yesterday.</p>
<p>I posted <em>another</em> guide for Text Case on my blog today, this time about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/using-siri-with-text-case/">using Siri Shortcuts and the Shortcuts app</a>. I originally planned to have one more, just so I could make it a full week. But I never actually worked out what the fifth guide would be about, as I think the four current guides explain the app quite well. I would place about a 5% chance of there being another guide, so I hope they’re useful to people!</p>
<p>The main thing that made today more interesting, was Captain Marvel. I literally just walked in the house, after seeing it with my sister. It was a really great film, I rank it very highly with some of the best Marvel films. It’s made even more eager to watch Avengers: Endgame when it comes out! I would totally recommend anyone to go and see Captain Marvel, whether you’re familiar with the Marvel universe or not.</p>
