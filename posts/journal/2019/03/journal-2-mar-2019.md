<p>It was a big day for football today! Time for a North London Derby, with Arsenal playing Tottenham at “their ground”. I was watching it in a pub with friends. It was a game full of referring mistakes, and although for most of the game Arsenal were winning, Tottenham were given an incorrect penalty and it ended in a draw. There were positivities to take from it though, and we still didn’t lose, so that’s not as bad.</p>

<p>After getting back from the pub, I was greeted with a delivery. It was a bonsai tree that I ordered a few days ago. It’s a Zelkova (Japanese Elm) and it’s going to be sat on my desk in my home office.</p>
<p>In the evening, I’ve been playing some more World of Warcraft either side of dinner. I think I’m getting hooked on it again.</p>
