<p>Today was quite a slow day at work, we wrapped up our last sprint (2 weeks of work), and all the teams in the department came together to do a huge demo to each other. Mine was obviously the most interesting ðŸ˜œ. Seeing as I demoed a complete app that I released, and other people were demoing a lot less.</p>
<p>I spent some time at lunch working on some of Text various bits of copy for Text Case, and I feel like I now have a basic idea of how Iâ€™m planning the release, and also a few things afterwards.</p>
<p>On the blog, in <a href="https://chrishannah.me/beyond-spectre-1-0/">linked to an article from the developer of Spectre</a>, about how the release went, and what they have planned for the future. Iâ€™ve got a few extra things lined up that I want to share, but I didnâ€™t find the time today.</p>
<p>Tonight has been spend watching things. First of all I watched the Arsenal vs Rennes game, we (Arsenal) played very well, and we came away with a 3-0 win. Which was enough to secure qualification into the Europa League quarter finals!</p>
<p>After that, me and my girlfriend have been continuing with After Life. Weâ€™ve managed another three episodes tonight, theyâ€™re just so funny and easy to binge watch.</p>
