<p>It’s not long after 10pm here, but this week has really tired me out to the point t that I’m now completely shattered. So I’m going for a super early night (usually I’m up well past 12).</p>
<p>That means, this won’t be a very long journey al entry. Thankfully, I don’t actually get up to much.</p>
<p>I went to work as usual, came back home, cooked a pasta bake for dinner, did some cleaning round the house, and the man I played about ten minutes of World of Warcraft. In the mean time I watch loads more Lost!</p>
<p>That’s all you’re getting from me today. Come back tomorrow for more of the regular scheduled journal content.</p>
<p>I’m going to bed.</p>
