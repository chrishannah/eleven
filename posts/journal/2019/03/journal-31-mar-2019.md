<p>It was Mothers Day today, so obviously I spent my afternoon at the parents house. Me and my girlfriend went to see hers afterwards, so it wasn&#8217;t one-sided.</p>
<p>After spending time with out families, it was just about time for dinner. After which, I popped out for coffee with a few friends, and I&#8217;m now sat in front of Netflix.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say I had an extravagant day, but it was good to get out of the house and see our families!</p>
