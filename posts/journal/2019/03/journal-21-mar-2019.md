<p>Today started with a bowl of cereal and a coffee for breakfast.</p>
<p>After we were sorted, we went out for a coffee at a cafe. And then continued to walk round more of the city, including the harbour, and a war museum that we stumbled across.</p>
<p>For lunch I had a tuna baguette at a sandwich bar, it was <em>alright</em>, but I couldn&#8217;t identify some of the salad that was inside of it.</p>

<p>Somehow we ended up in a Zoology museum in the afternoon, which had a Tyrannosaurus Rex fossil, and various nature scenes with stuffed animals, and realistic environments. It was pretty cool!</p>
<p>We then spend the rest of the day walking and exploring further parts of Oslo, before heading to a good market for dinner. It was time for another burger, but this time it was a vegan stall, so I got a jackfruit burger. It was okay, but I&#8217;ve certainly had better.</p>
<p>Here are some photos from today:</p>
