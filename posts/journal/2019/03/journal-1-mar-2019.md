<p>It was a very interesting day at work. We spent the second half of it doing listening to some internal tech talks that people made, and a few cool workshops, with my favourite being one about thinking of an idea about your first talk. I may end up doing one myself!</p>
<p>On the train home, I wrote a <a href="https://chrishannah.me/a-can-that-runs-as-fast-as-your-cpu/">piece about a cool menu bar app I found called RunCat</a>. It’s basically a running cat animation that syncs to your CPU speed.</p>
<p>When I got home I just watched YouTube for an hour, and ate dinner. But then I got invited to the pub, so I’ve been there for a few hours with friends.</p>
<p>Now I’m back at home again, so I’m watching the latest episode of The Instance, and I’ll probably end up playing World of Warcraft in a minute! I keep thinking to myself about the time, but then I remember it’s Friday!</p>
