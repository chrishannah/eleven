<p>Back to work today, after a very quick weekend. And it didn&#8217;t start particularly well. First of all, the trains had issues, so I got to work late. But I also forgot my badge for the building, and also my office floor (I keep them together). Turns out when I unpacked my bag for something on Friday, and repacked it yesterday, I left that on the kitchen table. Needless to say, it&#8217;s ready in my bag for tomorrow.</p>
<p>After I got home, I was greeted with pie and mash for dinner, that my girlfriend had made before going on a night shift. It was <em>very</em> nice!</p>
<p>In the evening, I&#8217;ve been relaxing with some podcasts, Youtube, and some World of Warcraft. But also doing a but more laundry that I should have got done over the weekend.</p>
<p>One video that I have to mention, is one that appeared on my YouTube Recommend section about mental health. It&#8217;s about an hour long discussion, and the reason it instantly appealed to me were the people that were in it. It features HRH the Duke of Cambridge, Gareth Southgate, Peter Crouch, Thierry Henry, Danny Rose and Jermaine Jenas. And it was a really fascinating video. I&#8217;d definitely recommend watching.</p>
