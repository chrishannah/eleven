<p>I didn’t exactly have a morning today, as I slept in for an extra few hours while my girlfriend went to have breakfast. It wasn’t a big deal though, as today was going to be a relaxing day by the pool anyway.</p>
<p>After a few hours at the pool, we had lunch, then got ready and headed to a nearby beach. We arrived, sat down, and maybe after 5 minutes of being there, the heavens opened. Grey clouds appeared, rain started coming down, and we could hear thunder. This lasted for long enough that we just gave up on the idea of the beach and went back to the hotel.</p>
<p>In the evening we did the usual routine, except now we’ve finished the 11th series of The Big Bang Theory, so we’re going to have to start something else!</p>
