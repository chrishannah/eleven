<p>We started the day by waking up a bit later than we expected, so we only just made the all-inclusive breakfast.</p>
<p>Then we basically laid around the pool for the rest of the day. With Mexican tortillas for lunch in between.</p>
<p>After we had a bit more sun, and had a shower, we went back to the restaurant for dinner. Once we’d filled ourselves with ice cream, we explored a tiny bit of the local beach at night. Which wasn’t particularly interesting, as you couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>We walked back to the room, and it was pretty close to bed time. So we watched a far few episodes of the Big Bang Theory and went to sleep.</p>
