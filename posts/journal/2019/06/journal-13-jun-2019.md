<p>As usual, the trains had problems this morning, which meant I got into work late. Annoyingly, that has become a regular occurrence lately.</p>
<p>After work today it was a bit better, as it was someones last day. So we went to the pub for leaving drinks, and I ended up getting home at about 10 pm.</p>
<p>Luckily when I got back, my girlfriend had cooked dinner! Afterwards we watched some Big Bang Theory, but I didn&#8217;t make it that far as I fell asleep on the sofa.</p>
