<p>It was my first day back at work today, after my short trip to Scotland. I was totally not ready for it. However, I did finally get to do some Swift development later in the day, and tomorrow I will be doing the same! It sounds weird, an iOS developer not writing Swift, but our whole team has been moved to another short-term project, so it’s not an ideal situation.</p>
<p>I did manage to fit in a lot of WWDC content, which I’m very much relieved with. As I was falling behind with all of it, since being away without a reliable internet connection, and spare time to watch videos. I finished off the Keynote, watched “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/06/the_talk_show_live_from_wwdc_2019">The Talk Show Live</a>”, a bit of State of the Union, and also listened to <a href="https://appstories.net/episodes/114/">Federico Viticci’s great interview with Craig Federighi</a>.</p>
