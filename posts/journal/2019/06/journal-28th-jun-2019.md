<p>Finally, it&#8217;s Friday.</p>
<p>After a long week, it was surprisingly a more relaxing day at work. There was a lot of discussions about things, but it was more an issue of time rather than effort. Which can be annoying sometimes, but I didn&#8217;t mind as it was a Friday.</p>
<p>After I got home, it was my turn to make dinner, as my girlfriend was working a super long shift. Basically all day. So I made a chilli con carne, and it was pretty tasty!</p>
<p>Not long after I ate that, I went out for a drink as it was a pretty good day still. It appears summer is finally arriving in England.</p>
<p>In the evening, I was still on my own, so I spent that time playing Fifa, and watching an episode of <a href="https://patreon.com/originspodcast?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare2">The Origins Podcast</a>. It&#8217;s hosted by the theoretical physicist, Lawrence Krauss, and the first episode was with Ricky Gervais. It was a mix of intelligent conversations and humour. And it&#8217;s also the first thing that I&#8217;ve ever become subscribed to on Patreon, as it&#8217;s only $2 a month for full video access, and they tend to be over an hour long.N</p>
