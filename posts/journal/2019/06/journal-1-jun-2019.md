<p>Today was pretty much a day of preparing for a family trip to Scotland tomorrow. That included getting the house ready for the cat sitters, getting a few things and packing for the trip, and also the boring chores that come with owning a house.</p>
<p>Apart from the boring things, I did release an update to Text Case today. Itâ€™s nothing major, just a new format called Clap Case, that inserts clapping hands emoji between words. It was suggested by a friend on Twitter, so I just did it quickly!</p>
<p>Turns out it was much quicker than I thought, with the app update taking less than 12 hours to go from me submitting it, to it being available in the store. You can <a href="https://chrishannah.me/text-case-can-clap-for-you-now-%f0%9f%91%8f/">read the blog post about it</a>, and also <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1407730596?mt=8&amp;uo=4">find it on the App Store</a>.</p>
