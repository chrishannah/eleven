<p>I was slightly more productive today than the rest of the week. Work was okay, and I made some good progress in a new service we&#8217;re building. So that was pleasant.</p>
<p>When I got home, it was still sunny, and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. So I made the effort to get the lawnmower out and cut the grass in the back garden.</p>
<p>After dinner, we had my mum and sister round for coffee. Once they were gone, it was basically time for bed!</p>
