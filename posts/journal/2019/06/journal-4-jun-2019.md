<p>Again, we started the day with a breakfast at the hotel.</p>
<p>Later on the day we headed to Glasgow central. We walked around the city for a bit, before heading to the science centre. That was pretty fun for a few hours.</p>
<p>Afterwards we headed back to Cartsdyke, where we met loads of my family for dinner. Some from Greenock (local) and others that were over from Australia. It was a very busy night.</p>
<p>When the restaurant was empty, we headed back to Greenock for a drink with one of my cousins. After one drink, my mum, sister, girlfriend, and my brothers girlfriend went back to hotel, and we stayed for a few more. It was an enjoyable night, but itâ€™s certainly now time for bed.</p>
