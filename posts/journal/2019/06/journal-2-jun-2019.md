<p>We landed in Glasgow at around 9 am this morning. And we quickly all got together and had a Scottish breakfast at a pub. As far as I can tell, it’s an English breakfast with a potato scone.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we got to the hotel and everyone seemed to have a nap, before heading out to my cousins house. As we had a lot of ripple visiting from all over, we had a whole mix of accents, with English, Scottish, and Australian, and a lot of in between.</p>
<p>We had dinner, some drinks, and some NERF fights. Now we’re just getting ready for bed!</p>
