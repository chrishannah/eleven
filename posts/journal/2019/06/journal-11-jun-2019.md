<p>I had a pretty average day at work today, so unfortunately nothing to ramble about.</p>
<p>During the day something interesting did happen though, and it was a review for my app Text Case! It was <a href="https://beautifulpixels.com/iphone/text-case-utility-app-convert-text-into-formats/">covered at Beautiful Pixels</a>, and I’m very thankful of the review!</p>
<p>After work my girlfriend made dinner while I was doing the washing up. And after she left for work, I’ve mainly just been watching YouTube videos with my cat! It also coincides with me laying in bed, and realising at 10 pm that I’m actually ready to go to sleep.</p>
<p>So I’m publishing this, and it’s time for an early night.</p>
