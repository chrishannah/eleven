<p>Today was my last work day before I go on holiday for a week!</p>
<p>It wasn’t the busiest day, as I couldn’t pick up any substantial bits of work before leaving. However, there were updates to two of our apps that I finalised, and should be released while I’m away! So that was a good way to end the week.</p>
<p>After work, I headed back into London for dinner with some friends. We went to a vegan pizza restaurant called Purezza, which still beats any non-vegan pizza I’ve ever eaten.</p>
