<p>Today was a big day! We finally let the cat out of the house.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s been housebound for quite some time. For multiple reasons, including the few holidays we&#8217;ve been on recently, and the lack of time where myself and my girlfriend are both in the house together.</p>
<p>But, today we were finally both in, it was a sunny day, and in the afternoon we were having a cat flap fitted. He absolutely loved it, and it didn&#8217;t take him long to be out circling the block. Luckily he came back though.</p>
<p>So in the afternoon we had my girlfriends family round. Her dad fitted the cat flap, and everyone was doing some kind of work, whether it as housework or gardening.</p>
<p>In the evening we went to my aunts house for a big family party. And that ended up lasting until about 11 pm! So hopefully that won&#8217;t affect me tomorrow at work.</p>
