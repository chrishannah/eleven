<p>Today was meant to be one full of packing and tidying the house. Instead it was a very short lived day. Mainly due to the fact that myself and my girlfriend woke at around 1 pm!</p>
<p>After that we somehow wasted a few hours, then we went to town for a few last minute items needed for our holiday.</p>
<p>Once we were back it was around 7:30 pm. So after eating dinner, there was not much time left for anything really.</p>
