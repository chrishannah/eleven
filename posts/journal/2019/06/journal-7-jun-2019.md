<p>It feels a little underwhelming, but after just a two-day work week, it’s the weekend!</p>
<p>I spent today at work doing some tweaks and branding changes to a few of our iOS apps. It wasn’t exactly ideal work, but it’s a lot more interesting than the stuff I’ve been working on recently.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, I consumed a bit more WWDC content, but still nowhere near enough. I swear I’ll be watching sessions for another year. It wasn’t all WWDC videos I was watching though, as I also listened to the Connected and most of the ATP (so far) episodes that were recorded live in San Jose.</p>
<p>It wasn’t all work and consumption though.</p>
<p>Because I also managed to do a bit of development when I got home. Technically it was more just me playing around for about 30 minutes, but I did manage to get Text Case working on the Mac!</p>
<p>Just a warning, it&#8217;s by no means perfect. But this is straight out of the box so I wasn&#8217;t expecting much. The main issues I see myself are the rounding of cells in settings table views, a few spacing/margin bugs, and for some reason images that don&#8217;t conform to their constraints and masks and cover half of the screen. (This is also an issue with the current version of Text Case running on the iOS 13 beta.)</p>
<p>Here are a few screenshots of the very first build of Text Case for Mac:</p>
