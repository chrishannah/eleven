<p>Me and my girlfriend finally had a lie in for once. We woke between 11 and 12 am, which was totally deserved.</p>
<p>We then took some things we got from Scotland, like black pudding and square sausage, to my girlfriends mums house so we could all have a late breakfast. That led into a coffee/tea and television.</p>
<p>After we’d finished talking, we went home to get ready for my girlfriends sisters birthday party. Which was Harry Potter themed. My girlfriend went as Sybil Trelawney, and I just went as a generic wizard with a gown and shirt.</p>
<p>The party was very fun. And that was probably aided by the fact there was draught beer, which you could use yourself. I pretty much had an infinite beer.</p>
<p>It’s now pretty late, and I’ll be going to bed soon. We’re all sleeping in tents in the party hall, so in the morning we can have a good breakfast!</p>
