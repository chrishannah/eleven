<p>It&#8217;s our last day in Cyprus, and it&#8217;s certainly been a lazy one!</p>
<p>We sat by the pool for the whole day, stopping only for lunch, and drinks at the bar.</p>
<p>Our transfer back to the airport was at 6 pm, and it we only arrived at the airport just after 7 pm. Once we got there, we had around three hours until our flight departed for England. We filled that time with wandering around the airport and eating dinner.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s as glamorous as it got for the entire day. Because as soon as we got on the flight, myself and my girlfriend both watched a movie on our iPads using the pretty cool in-flight entertainment app (I watched Johnny English 2), and then tried to sleep for the rest of it!</p>
