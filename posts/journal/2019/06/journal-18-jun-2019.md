<p>We started the day with the all-inclusive breakfast, which isn’t actually that extravagant. But it’s better than nothing.</p>
<p>As usual, after eating, we went back to the room to apply the endless amount of suncream needed for Cyprus, and headed out.</p>
<p>We went to the main Ayia Napa strip, where we visited quite a few random shops. And just because it was there, we had lunch at KFC! Strangely, there was one corner with a KFC, Burger King, Pizza Hut, and a Costa, all seemed pretty familiar to me.</p>
<p>On the way back to the hotel, we walked back via the beach so my girlfriend could have a swim in the sea. I have no intention ever of swimming in the sea, but I’m happy sitting nearby reading or taking photos.</p>
<p>Turns out we also walked back a slightly wrong direction which took us about 15 minutes longer, but we saw some wild kittens which were very playful. So it worked out.</p>
<p>After we were back, we got sorted for dinner, and headed back to the restaurant.</p>
<p>In the evening we sat in the hotels bar outside so we could play  DS together. My girlfriend has a “X number of games in one” game, so we played a few card games.</p>
<p>When we were bored with that, we continued tradition by watching a few episodes of The Big Bang Theory and went to bed.</p>
