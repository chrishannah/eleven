<p>We started the day with a full Scottish/English breakfast at the hotel. Followed by a day of travelling around the area.</p>
<p>It included a lot of different areas, shops, and activities, but we essentially travelled through Gourock to Wemyss Bay, got the ferry to Rothesay, spent a while there, and then came back across to Gourock. Once we got back there, we walked along the esplanade until we got back to a restaurant to eat dinner.</p>
<p>After dinner, we completed the tiny journey to the hotel. And played some card games with some alcohol.</p>
<p>I was planning to watch at least some part of WWDC. Usually I watch the Keynote in Starbucks, followed by the State of the Union at home. However, as I’m on holiday, I expected to at least have the keynote downloaded so I can watch before going to bed. But the download is still not available, so that’s going to have to wait until at least tomorrow.</p>
<p>Another bad thing is the betas. Right now, you need a Mac to get the iOS and iPadOS betas. Of course, I only brought my iPad to Scotland.</p>
