<p>It was a very nice day today, and turns out I spent most of the day inside!</p>
<p>My girlfriend was at work, so I had the day to myself pretty much.</p>
<p>I started with some World of Warcraft and Fifa, but eventually I got around to do so some chores. I got the lawn mower out and trimmed the grass in the front garden, so that&#8217;s one thing I don&#8217;t have to worry about for another few weeks.</p>
<p>Seeing as it was sunny outside, I enjoyed the afternoon sun by watching Stormy&#8217;s Glastonbury set on television. It was really impressive, and I can certainly see why he was the headline act.</p>
<p>In the evening, I basically played more games, entertained the cat, and relaxed with some television!</p>
