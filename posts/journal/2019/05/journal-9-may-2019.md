<p>So today was the day of the work party. I went to work, and was delayed as usual.</p>
<p>But at 4:30 pm, the drinks fridge opened, and the party began.</p>
<p>We officially moved to the venue at around 6 pm, and I’m literally only just leaving at 11 pm. I had no intention of staying out this late. My original plan was to go for a couple of drinks, and then leave by about 8. That didn’t go so well.</p>
<p>So right now I have a bit of a headache, and now it’s time for the long commute home.</p>
