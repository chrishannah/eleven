<p>I started the day with a tiny bit of development on an app. I didn’t get very far though, as we did quite a lot of housework, so that took up a lot of time.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we had some of my girlfriends family round. We then met more of them afterwards when we went out for a Sunday roast!</p>
<p>After we got back home, we had tea and coffee with some remaining chocolate from Easter. I also managed to make my girlfriend watch Lion King 2. Which, shockingly, she had never seen.</p>
<p>We then watched YouTube for quite a while afterwards, all relating to DIY, and small “hacks” you can do to make your home look better. That’s sort of decided our plan for tomorrow. I expect some kind of DIY will be done.</p>
