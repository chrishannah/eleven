<p>I wont bore everyone too much in this post, so I’ll skip over the various small things I did today.</p>
<p>However, I will point out that I have become fully domesticated, and spent my morning/afternoon doing housework. How I’ve changed.</p>
<p>At dinner we watched a film on Netflix about the Scottish Wildcat, called The Tigers of Scotland. It was pretty fascinating!</p>
<p>And just now, we’ve booked a week trip to Cyprus! A bit last minute, as we’re going in just 20 days, but it’s going to be our first “real” holiday for the year. Not including the trip to Scotland we’re doing in a few days. 😉</p>
