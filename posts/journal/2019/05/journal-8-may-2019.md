<p>Work as usual today. Nothing spectacular to note, the trains were even still annoying.</p>
<p>I did manage to finish John Wick 2 in my lunch time though, which means I‚Äôm now ready for when the third movie comes out!</p>
<p>On the way home from work, I started watching another tv series! This time it‚Äôs Lucifer, that‚Äôs back for a 4th season. I don‚Äôt expect it will take me long to finish the entire thing.</p>
<p>Tonight, I watched part of the Ajax game, and ate dinner with my girlfriend. We also played a tv/movie quiz game, which I narrowly won! üèÜ</p>
<p>Tomorrow I‚Äôm at a work party, so I just had to get some things ready for that. It may mean a very good or boring journal entry tomorrow.</p>
<p>Ajax game</p>
