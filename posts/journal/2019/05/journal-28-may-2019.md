<p>I’ve been trying to collect my wishes for iOS 13 for quite some time, however the list never grew that long. So, today I published <a href="https://chrishannah.me/my-short-list-of-ios-13-wishes/">my short list of iOS 13 wishes</a>.</p>
<p>In the non-work part of my day, I spent my time food shopping, and watching The Big Bang Theory with my girlfriend. We’ve gone back to the start of season 10, and already watched 4 episodes tonight. Hopefully it’s not long before we get to the latest season, I haven’t seen any of that yet!</p>
