<p>Work was a real mix today. I spent the morning figuring out issues we were having with provisioning profiles and certificates with our iOS apps. Then I was testing some APIs that are being migrated. And we were also discussing some micro services that myself and my team are going to be building soon, so that’s interesting.</p>
<p>During my commutes, and while I was eating dinner, I did catch up on Game of Thrones. Which means I’ve watched 5 episodes since the start of yesterday. Woops.</p>
<p>I haven’t been <em>that</em> active on my blog recently, but I did link to a great article by Jordan Merric, where <a href="https://chrishannah.me/managing-instagram-hashtag-sets/">he shared some tips on how you can manage Instagram Hashtag sets</a>.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m just getting sorted, and I’m planning to have an early night. I’m not sure how it’s going to turn out though.</p>
