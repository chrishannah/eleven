<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning I was started my working week with a quick coffee with my cat. It seems to have gotten into a fairly regular routine, where when I get out of bed, he comes down with me for a short period of time, before going back upstairs to bed for a few hours.</p>
<p>I did eventually leave for work, and thanks to multiple issues with trains (including the theft of signalling cable), I was about an hour late.</p>
<p>After work, I went straight to my girlfriends parents with her for dinner. And we were there for the entire evening, watching various shows on TV. I also kept up with the Liverpool vs Barcelona game, which is a tremendous result for Liverpool!</p>
