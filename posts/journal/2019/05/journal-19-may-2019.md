<p>After getting in at about 3/3:30 am, I woke up with a rather sore back. I have no idea how I caused it, but I bet it was while I was in a drunken state last night.</p>
<p>Between the morning and early evening, we were mainly playing computer games, and entertaining the cat!</p>
<p>For dinner, we were invited round to my girlfriends parents house for a Sunday roast. And after that we stayed for a few extra hours while we talked about gardening, and what I can do with our new garden.</p>
