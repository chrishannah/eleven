<p>Nothing special about my work day today, but after work I went to Vegan Nights!</p>

<p>That of course, means I had vegan food for dinner. I had barbecue ribs and chips. The ribs were basically slabs of seitan in a barbecue sauce. Sadly I’d only rate it 6/10. However I did have a blueberry cheesecake, which was very nice!</p>
<p>The train home was another huge chunk of the day. So I spent that reading Twitter, Micro.blog, News, and even played around with my phone in greyscale mode. I was pretty bored.</p>
<p>Now I’ve had a shower and I was just about to get my laptop out. But my girlfriend helpfully reminded me that it’s nearly 12, so it’s basically bedtime!</p>
