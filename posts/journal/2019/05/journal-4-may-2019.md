<p>I woke up today to a very quiet house. My girlfriend was at work, and my cat was asleep.</p>
<p>For the first part of the day, I was watching countless videos on YouTube about gardening, DIY, and practically anything else that YouTube recommended to me. The cat was also popping down regularly for attention, before going back to sleep on the bed.</p>
<p>I did a tiny bit of programming in the afternoon, which is the first real but if work for the app I mentioned a while back. It’s still a secret, but at least it’s officially begun development. I didn’t get much done, as my mum and sister cane round for a coffee. Luckily for them, the cat was very active, and played with them for a while.</p>
<p>In the evening, I cooked dinner, and watched some more YouTube at the same time. And after I ate, I went to the pub with a friend for a couple of pints!</p>
<p>After I got back, we played with the cat a bit, and somehow ended up watching The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.</p>
