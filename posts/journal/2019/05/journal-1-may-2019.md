<p>So it was pretty much a carbon copy of yesterday.</p>
<p>I went to work, and as usual, had issues with the trains. I did some more web development, which I also coordinated with a designer on. That was the fist time I think that me and a designer have worked on something together, and i was honestly surprised by the results. Although I canâ€™t share anything here unfortunately.</p>
<p>After work, I finally managed to see my girlfriend, after her two night shifts. We cooked quesadillas for dinner, and then I partially watched the Barcelona vs Liverpool game, and we also watched some random shows that she likes, and I secretly pay attention to.</p>
<p>I also got in a bit of World of Warcraft, and we played with the cat loads. So all-in-all, a pretty good day.</p>
