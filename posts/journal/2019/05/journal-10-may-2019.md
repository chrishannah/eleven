<p>After the work party last night, I decided that I’d work from home today. There was no way I could get up at 6:30 this morning and make my way in. So I got an extra bit of sleep, and somewhat worked as normal (I wasn’t fully recovered yet).</p>
<p>After I was officially finished for the day, I did manage to get in a bit of housework, and I could cook dinner for myself and my girlfriend. We had a curry with all the accompaniments!</p>
<p>In the evening, I popped out for a coffee at the beloved Starbucks.</p>
<p>Now, I’m watching Lucifer season 4. I’ve literally just watched three episodes back to back, and I’m guessing I’ll have to watch another two at least. I was starting to think that I’ll have to head up to bed soon. Then I realised three things, I’m an adult, I own my own house (well, with my girlfriend), and I have no work tomorrow. So I’m pretty sure I’m allowed to do whatever I want!</p>
