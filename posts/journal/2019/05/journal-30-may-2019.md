<p>Work was pretty fun today. Nothing spectacular, but we had a lot of funny conversations throughout the team, and we even got a lot of work done.</p>
<p>I’m still looking forward to tomorrow, as it’s my last work day until next Thursday. As I’m off to Scotland on Sunday!</p>
<p>Over here on the blog I was a bit more active than usual.I published three things!</p>
<p>Firstly I linked to a piece about an <a href="https://chrishannah.me/open-letter-to-gchq-on-the-threats-posed-by-the-ghost-proposal-%e2%86%92/">Open Letter to GCHQ</a> regarding their Ghost Protocol idea. I then linked to a <a href="https://chrishannah.me/create-better-text-shots-for-twitter-using-linky-%e2%86%92/">review of the recent update to Linky on MacStories</a>. And finally I wrote a full article about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/how-i-automate-publishing-blog-posts/">how I automate publishing blog posts</a>.</p>
<p>In the evening I popped out for a coffee, played some World of Warcraft Classic, and watched a ton more Big Bang Theory with my girlfriend.</p>
