<p>Who would have guessed, it was time for another coffee tonight. I&#8217;m getting to a stage where they know my order, and occasionally remember my name. Maybe I need to go a tiny bit more often for them to remember. Clearly 2 or 3 times a week isn&#8217;t enough.</p>
<p>I did manage to get in about an hour of World of Warcraft as well tonight, which is honestly getting a bit boring. I tried to combat this by playing on a low-level character, going through old content. But there&#8217;s only so much of this you can play in one go.</p>
<p>Finally, I activated my Micro.blog hosted micro blog. I <a href="https://chrishannah.micro.blog/2019/05/21/ive-decided-to.html">wrote about it on the blog</a>, and of course you can find my blog over at <a href="https://chrishannah.micro.blog">chrishannah.micro.blog</a>. I should have a cleaner redirect available from micro.chrishannah.me, but that&#8217;s pending on the SSL activation, as my domain is HTTPS only.</p>
