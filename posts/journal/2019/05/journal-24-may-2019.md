<p>It was a slightly productive day at work today. I was pairing with someone while writing some tests in Java, and a I also helped infrastructure/api developers move one of our apis into AWS. It was certainly not as straightforward as it was suggested.</p>
<p>After I got home, I cooked barbecue chicken and potato wedges for dinner. My girlfriend would have cooked, however it appears she’s coming down with a flu. So that was my job.</p>
<p>She did make me a cheesecake though! A very nice one made with malteasers. It’s going to last for quite some time as well.</p>
<p>After we ate, we watched the film Lucy, as it was on television. It’s still absolutely weird. Fascinating though.</p>
<p>My girlfriend is now tired from being ill, and I’m just generally tired. So I’m writing this and then I’ll be going to bed.</p>
