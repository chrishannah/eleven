<p>Just before yet another bank holiday weekend, I ended up working from home. There are some negatives to not being in the office with my team, but there are quite a lot of positives. One being the fact that I can go out for lunch with my girlfriend!</p>
<p>After work I managed to watch the live recording of The Instance, which is a video podcast about World of Warcraft and other Blizzard games. I never really get to listen/watch this as it’s about the time when I’m commuting home.</p>
<p>For dinner we had a Chinese takeaway. And afterwards I ended up watching Casino Royale, just because it happened to be on the TV when we finished. I’m not a die hard James Bond fan, but I can appreciate them if I’m coerced into watching them. Admittedly, it being on the same channel that the TV was tuned to wasn’t really coercion. It’s more a perspective of my laziness.</p>
