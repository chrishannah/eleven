<p>It was a relatively quiet day at work today. A few people were on holiday, and we had some meetings scattered throughout. Not a hugely productive day for anyone.</p>
<p>After work, me and my girlfriend went out for date night. We went to a local Indian restaurant which was very nice!</p>
<p>Now we’re going to bed, and about to watch A Bugs Life. All because I told her that the caterpillar is called Heimlich and she didn’t believe me.</p>
