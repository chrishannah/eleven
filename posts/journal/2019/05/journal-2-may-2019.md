<p>Just about the end of the working week, and it feels like it’s gone pretty fast!</p>
<p>After work I cooked pasta bake for myself and my girlfriend, and then I managed to watch the Arsenal game in between. We beat Valencia 3-1!</p>
<p>After that we played some Call of Duty on the PS3, and then attempted to play a board game. It was a trivia game about TV Shows and Movies, and it turns out that we’re too tired for that. So it’s time for bed.</p>
