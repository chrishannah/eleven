<p>Today was very much a continuation of the weekend, in that we basically did a bit of housework, but mainly lounged around the house watching television.</p>
<p>Late afternoon we did have some of my family round for coffee and cake, so we weren’t completely shut away from the outside world.</p>
<p>In the evening, I very much benefitted from my girlfriend being ill, as I managed to (partially) make her watch Harry Potter. We watched Order of the Phoenix, so maybe I’ll try another one soon.</p>
