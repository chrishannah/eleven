<p>Today was a housework day. My girlfriend was coming home in the late afternoon, so I got the house cleaned and tidy. I also did the usual laundry type chores.</p>
<p>After I was done cleaning my own house, I went to my parents house to get their house ready as well. As we were having a barbecue for my brothers 21st birthday. It was a pretty good night, with a lot of alcohol being drunk. And according to my girlfriend I was actually drunk for once!</p>
<p>In the day time I did manage to publish two things to the blog:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chrishannah.me/theyre-features-not-bugs/">Theyâ€™re Features, Not Bugs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rocketpanda.net/2019/05/3-stooges-syndrome/">3 Stooges Syndrome</a></li>
</ul>
