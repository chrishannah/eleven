<p>I woke up this morning to an even more ill girlfriend. Which meant we immediately went on a trip to get some flu medicine, and also a fan for the bedroom.</p>
<p>After we were back, I went to a local vegan fair with a friend, where I purchased 4 cupcakes. I haven’t ate them yet, but they do look rather impressive.</p>
<p>After I got back, me and my girlfriend both sat in the living room with various live music videos on the television, while gaming, playing on our phones, etc.</p>
<p>I did also get a new toy to play with today, a Logitech Slim Folio. I’m certainly behind on this one, but I already cant see how I coped without it. It’s far superior to the Smart Keyboard.</p>
<p>On the blog, I linked to an article I read about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/hugh-grant-was-never-too-keen-on-that-beloved-love-actually-dance-scene-%e2%86%92/">Hugh Grant’s opinions on the famous dancing scene in Love Actually</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I quickly popped out for a coffee, and we’ve been watching tv and playing with the cat!</p>
