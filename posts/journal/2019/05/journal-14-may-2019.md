<p>My girlfriend left for Spain this afternoon, so this morning was the last time I saw her. It now means I’m living by myself for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll notice it too much, as it’s only the work week, so most of my time is spent on the commute and at work anyway. However, it still will be a bit weird. And very quiet! Sometimes that can be a good thing, but we’ll see.</p>
<p>As I’m on my own, I had to make myself dinner, which was spaghetti bolognese. That will also automatically become my lunch for tomorrow at work, so that’s very handy.</p>
<p>In the evening, I’ve basically just been watching YouTube. It’s been a random assortment of TED talks, stoicism, journalling, general productivity, and writing videos. There’s a lot to learn on YouTube.</p>
