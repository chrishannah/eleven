<p>Not much to say about the first half of the day. Just that I went to work, and did some web development! Nothing really stood out as being exceptionally good or bad.</p>
<p>I did do a lot of reading today though, as cleared out/read about 60 articles in my RSS reader, and Becky Hansmeyer wrote something about App Store Pricing that I had to <a href="https://chrishannah.me/app-store-pricing-%e2%86%92/">link to here on the blog</a>.</p>
<p>My girlfriend make pulled pork in the slow cooker today, which was very nice. After we ate that, we played a quick game of checkers/droughts on my iPad as sheâ€™d never played before, and then we watched at least an hour of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air clips on YouTube.</p>
