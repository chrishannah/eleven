<p>It was a quiet day at work. A lot of people were working from home, which meant less chatting. And, of course, we were a tad more productive.</p>
<p>After work, I was presented with a new lawn mower from my dad. So I immediately cut the grass in our back garden as soon as I got home. This took longer than I thought. But it turns out the included cable is really long, as is a perfect fit for our garden. So no extension leads were needed at all.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;d finished all the gardening for the day. I cooked dinner, and caught up with the latest episode of The Instance podcast. Which <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/432523212">I do on Twitch</a>, as that&#8217;s where they stream and host the live video.</p>
<p>Since then I&#8217;ve just been finishing up a <em>very</em> small update to Text Case. It&#8217;s nothing serious, just a funny addition that a friend suggested. Hopefully it&#8217;s released soon!</p>
