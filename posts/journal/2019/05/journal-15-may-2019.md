<p>Work slightly as usual today. I’m still working on the same non-mobile project, so I was doing some web/server development. However, I was tasked with a small mobile task, so that was slightly more fun!</p>
<p>After work, I’ve been mainly watching Game of Thrones. I decided earlier that I would try to catch up with the current episodes, and as I remembered, I last watched the first few episodes of season 7. Turns out, either my memory is bad, or I really underestimated the number of episodes in that season. As I’d watched all but about 15 minutes of the last episode.</p>
<p>That means I’m now on season 8, and about to watch the super long third episode!</p>
<p>It wasn’t all laying in front of an iPad though, I did pop out for a quick coffee as usual.</p>
<p>One last thing. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">Federico Viticci</a>‘s and <a href="https://twitter.com/iryantldr">Ryan Crystoffel</a>’s new podcast, <a href="https://www.relay.fm/adapt/">Adapt</a>, I now have the plan for the next update to Text Case! <a href="https://www.relay.fm/adapt/1">Listen to the first episode if you want a clue</a>.</p>
