<p>I ended up working from home today. It sounds good, but the internet connection at work has been having issues recently, so any kind of video call is a pain.</p>
<p>Luckily it meant I could be home as soon as I finished working. I spent the next few hours playing a relatively new character on World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>I then “popped out” for some food shopping with my girlfriend, and about an hour and £120 later, we’re done. That should be us fully stocked for a while!</p>
<p>We’ve since had pizza for dinner and been watching some YouTube videos.</p>
<p>My plan for tonight was to stay awake, and then take part in the World of Warcraft Classic beta event. However, in my local time it’s 12 am to 2 am, so it would not be the best decision. And it’s just about 11 pm and I’m getting tired. I guess I won’t be able to make it.</p>
