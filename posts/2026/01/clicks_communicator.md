# Clicks Communicator

[Clicks](https://clicksphone.com/en/communicator):

> A new kind of mobile communicator
>
> Designed for doing, not doomscrolling.

That tagline definitely got my attention.

Based on the design and some of the copy, it made me think it was a more focused phone. 

It's noticeably smaller, there's a smaller screen, physical keyboard, single camera, and a headphone jack.

But it's marketed as a *companion* device?

I don't see why it couldn't be used as a primary phone, but the second-phone idea feels a bit weird to me. Maybe they're just playing it safe? Is it easier to convince people to use this as an additional device than it is to get people to switch away from an iPhone to this "communicator"?

Nevertheless, I'm still interested.

There's a possibility that this idea of a dedicated device will fit into the growing use of other dedicated devices, such as iPods, cameras, etc. 

It's obviously still a smartphone, but it's at least targeted as being a dedicated communication device, rather than an all-purpose handheld computer. The question is, will that actually make a difference?
