title: The Humane Ai Pin

[Humane](https://hu.ma.ne/media/humane-names-first-device-humane-ai-pin):

> The connected and intelligent clothing-based wearable device uses a range of sensors that enable contextual and ambient compute interactions.

Even though we've only come across very minimal press releases, and a short [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/imran_chaudhri_the_disappearing_computer_and_a_world_where_you_can_take_ai_everywhere), this device has already peaked my curiosity in a way that no other product has.

Sure, this product could a total disaster. But it could also be the next step in personal computers. The range of potential is huge.

I have so many questions about it, but for once I'm just allowing myself to be a _little_ excited.
