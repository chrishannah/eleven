title: Early Impressions of macOS Sonoma
---

I've been using Sonoma now for just a few days now, but there are a few things that I'm already impressed by.

## Wallpapers

The first being the new animated wallpapers, and how they transition from the Lock Screen to the desktop. It's such an *Apple* feature, which I don't feel like we've had for a while. The Lock Screen having an animated wallpaper would be great on it's own, but the fact that it slows down, and then settles on a frame is 10x better.

(I've just been going between the various Scotland options so far.)

## Web Apps in the Dock

Then I've got to mention having web apps in the Dock. I've already got 2 configured on my personal machine, [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/home), and [Chess.com](https://chess.com). And I've also set a few up on my work machine, for common web apps that I use, like, for example, our document management tool. Sometimes websites don't have apps, and sometimes the website is just better than the app, so I think I'm going to end up using these a lot.

Another bonus for this feature, is that if you view a website that you have added to your Dock, in Safari, it will prompt you to open it in the app instead.

## Desktop Widgets

Finally, there's Desktop Widgets. These are so much more useful than having it hidden away in a menu.

I've currently got just Weather, Calendar, and NetNewsWire widgets at the moment. I'm not sure if I'll ever have a ton, but just having these few details in a place where I'll see them often will be very useful.

These aren't exactly groundbreaking features. But I don't particularly want the Mac to keep changing. So these little touches go a long way for me.
