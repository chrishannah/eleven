Manuel Moreale [writing about supporting people online][m]:

> But I recently realized that tiers are the wrong approach. At least for me. I believe in kindness. I believe that if you decide to support something I do, you should get all the benefits, no matter how much you pay.

> I also realized that 1$+/month is the best price possible when it comes to supporting online creators. The 1$ part means you can set it up and forget about it because it’s a low enough amount that won’t make too much of a difference for the majority of people who are considering supporting online creators. The + part allows you to contribute more if you want to do so. And that’s just perfect.

As a result of this idea, I've also gone ahead and updated my Ko-fi page to be up to date, and to also have an option for a £1 a month membership.

Previously I've had links to BuyMeACoffee on my sites, but I think the idea of a £1 (or higher) subscription is a better model for supporting people like me online.

At the moment, this subscription is more of a tip to support the work I do here on my blog, and also the software I write. However, this may expand in the future.

For example, I've always liked the idea of a newsletter, and I've tried it a few times in the past, so I think I may bring that back at some point. And I also want to write more open-source software in the future. Right now the only open-source project I'm really working on is [Text Case CLI][tcc], and I think I want to do more of this in the future. Along with maybe even working on some free apps.

With all that being said, you can [find (and support) me on Ko-fi][k].
