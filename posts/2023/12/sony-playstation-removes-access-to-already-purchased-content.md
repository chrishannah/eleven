title: Sony Playstation Removes Access to Already Purchased Content
---

[PlayStation][src]:

> As of 31 December 2023, due to our content licensing arrangements with content providers, you will no longer be able to watch any of your previously purchased Discovery content and the content will be removed from your video library.

I'm so glad this didn't affect me. Because something like this would annoy me so much I'd stop buying things digitally. And I'm not quite ready for that yet.
