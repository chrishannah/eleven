title: 4 Days of Advent of Code
---

It's only the 4th of December, so there hasn't been much of [Advent of Code][aoc] so far. Just 8 puzzles, out of the 50 total that we will get to solve.

This is the first time that I'm attempting all of the puzzles, and my aim is do them roughly within the same day. Although I'm not sure I'll get much code written on Christmas Day. 

That being said, while some days have been tougher than others, I've had a lot of fun so far.

I've seen a lot of people talk about Advent of Code being the perfect tool to help you learn a new programming language. I'm not doing that myself, but I am writing it in Java 21, so I'm both refining my Java skills, and also seeing what is new with the language at the same time.

So far it's been mainly string manipulation, iterating through arrays, and some fiddly counting logic. It can be a bit tedious at times, but maybe after 25 days it will come a lot more naturally.

If you want to have a look at my solutions so far, I have [a public repo on GitHub][gh] with the logic for each puzzle.
