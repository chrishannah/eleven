title: Multiple device support is coming to WhatsApp
---

WhatsApp is [finally adding support for multiple devices sharing the same account](https://blog.whatsapp.com/one-whatsapp-account-now-across-multiple-phones):

> Today, weâ€™re improving our multi-device offering further by **introducing the ability to use the same WhatsApp account on multiple phones.**A feature highly requested by users, now you can link your phone as one of up to four additional devices, the same as when you link with WhatsApp on web browsers, tablets and desktops. Each linked phone connects to WhatsApp independently, ensuring that your personal messages, media, and calls are end-to-end encrypted, and if your primary device is inactive for a long period, we automatically log you out of all companion devices.

This was one of my biggest annoyances when I was going through a phase of switching back and forth between my iPhone and Pixel. This is going to make a whole lot of people's live easier.
