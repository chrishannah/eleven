title: Well, I Guess I'm a Java Developer
---

I've [written a few times about my progressional career as a software engineer][bp], and how I've had troubles working out what my programer *identity* was.

Needless to say, right now, professionally, I'm 90% a Java developer [^1].

With that in mind, I updated my LinkedIn and [my online CV][cv] to reflect my latest situation (and skills, experiences, etc.), and I'm now "officially" *casually* open for a new role. I say it like that, because I'm in no rush to leave my current role, but I've decided that I'm going to start keeping my ears peeled for any interesting opportunities.

I've also now decided to take a more formal approach to learning more about Java, and how I can become a better Java developer. Even though I used it for a few years at university, and also quite a number of years professionally, I think I'm going to try and focus more time on getting even better.

That has meant that I've been having some fun on [LeetCode][lc] solving various problems. But I'm going to have an attempt at this years [Advent of Code][aoc]. I've done some individual puzzles in the past, but I've never tried to do them each day (or close to) as they are available. So that should be fun.

I don't know if I'll be posting my Java-related content here. But it wouldn't surprise me if I decided to have fun with a few more side-projects while I spent more time refining my Java skills.
