title: Gran Canaria Photos
---

As you may have seen from my update on my micro blog and on social media, I've just came back from a week long trip to Gran Canaria. While I was there, I made full use of the beautiful scenery and landscapes, and took a ton of photos.

I've just finished refining a bunch of them, and I'm left with 14 photos that I'm really happy with.

*Note: I took a load more photos at the coast on the last day during sunset. I'm going to edit these separately, as I think they could serve as a great wallpaper pack. But whatever happens with them, I'll post about it here.*

All photos were taken on an iPhone 15 Pro Max.
