After really an unforgivable amount of time, it's _finally_ time for my app, Text Shot to be [available on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/text-shot/id6450152342).

It's a universal application (iOS/iPadOS/macOS) that lets you take snippets of text from anywhere (although it's designed for web pages), and to generate beautiful shareable images.

Like these:

All of the functionality is also available within the Shortcuts app, which means you can tie it into much more complex automations.

You can [read more about Text Shot on the website](https://chrishannah.me/text-shot/).
