It hasn't been long since [Text Shot](https://chrishannah.me/text-shot/) was released, but it's already time for the first update.

There is now some basic Markdown support for bold and italic text. Which means you can emphasise certain words and phrases.

You can also now choose different fonts for the highlight and the title/URL.

And there's also a bunch of optimisations that have been made to the text shot generation, so it should be a bit faster, more efficient, and stable.

If you haven't already, you can find [Text Shot for iOS and macOS on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/text-shot/id6450152342).
