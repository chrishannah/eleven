title: Create a 9-Patch Border with Broider
---

Pretty cool little tool by [Max Bittker](https://maxbittker.com/) to [make 9-patch borders in CSS](https://maxbittker.github.io/broider/). Reminds me very much of the pixel art in GameBoy games. If you notice a new border anywhere on my website soon, you know where it's from.
