title: What is Xcode Missing?
---

Xcode is a great IDE, but after using many other IDEs and text editors, I've noticed that it's missing quite a lot of common functionality. This page will serve as a growing list of features that I find useful in other applications, that Xcode does not have.

If you do find something here that has a solution, or has been addressed in an update, please [let me know](mailto:me@chrishannah.me).

## File Operations

* **You can't duplicate a file.** There isn't an option when you right-click a file, and you can't use the copy/paste commands on a file either.

## Project Navigation

* **There isn't a UI option to open the current file in the project navigator**. You can set up a manual keyboard shortcut, but that's it.

## Code Style

**Code style just isn't a _thing_ in Xcode.** Sure, there's SwiftLint and SwiftFormat, but both don't really work seamlessly with Xcode. Which means:

* You can't set a specific code style for a project to keep the code format consistent.
* You can't reformat a file or a selection of text to the "correct" format.
* You can't setup the code style to be applied on save.

## Other Miscellaneous Annoyances

* Xcode seems to think it's a suitable default application for practically any text file.
