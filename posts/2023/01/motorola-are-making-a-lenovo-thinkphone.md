title: Motorola Are Making a Lenovo ThinkPhone
---

Lenovo have announced that they are releasing a new phone, the ThinkPhone, which will be made by Motorola.

From [the official announcement](https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/thinkphone-by-motorola-unmatched-business-device-experience/), it seems as if this will be aimed more at the enterprise market, and especially at users of ThinkPad laptops. Users of a ThinkPad look to gain the bigger advantage of the ThinkPhone, as there various integrations, similar to what you would find in the Apple ecosystem, which they call "Think 2 Think". Here are a few that interested me:

* Unified clipboard between devices
* Unified notifications.
* File sharing between devices, similar to AirDrop.
* Stream Android apps from the phone to a PC.
* Using your phone camera as a webcam on a PC.

Not a bad list! And being a fan of the ThinkPad myself, I certainly appreciate the design of the ThinkPhone. Although, even though I am starting to appreciate more Android phones, such as the Pixel and the Nothing Phone, I can't say I have any intention of trying this one out. Although, [like I said about the Nothing Phone](https://chrishannah.me/i-hope-the-nothing-phone-does-well/), I still hope this does well.

When I first saw the headline about Lenovo releasing a ThinkPhone, I was partially hoping that it was based on a new OS, not iOS or Android, just to offer another competitor to the market. I guess the wait for that continues.
