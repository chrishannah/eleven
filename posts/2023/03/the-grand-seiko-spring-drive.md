title: The Grand Seiko Spring Drive
---

I've seen [Grand Seiko](https://www.grand-seiko.com/uk-en) watches before, but I've only ever really thought about them as a _dressed-up_ Seiko. Probably because I'd never actually researched into the unique movement that the watches have.

Personally, I'd always prefer a [mechanical movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_watch) over a battery-based [Quartz movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_clock). Especially if I'm spending a decent amount of money on a watch.

However, I wasn't aware that the Grand Seiko Spring Drive was it's own unique movement. In simplistic terms, it's a combination of a mechanical and Quartz movement. However, to say it's a hybrid approach is probably not giving it the credit it deserves.

Teddy Baldassarre has made [a great video that really shows the beauty of the Spring Drive movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVoRoK1u3Dg):

A mechanical watch movement, with the accuracy of a Quartz movement? I'm starting to think that I will eventually end up owning one of these.
