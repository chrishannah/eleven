title: I'll Read It
---

Manual Moreale is a very good advocate for writing a blog, and [has offered to help people to start writing by offering them a reader to start them off](https://manuelmoreale.com/i-ll-read-it):

> I'll read it. If you decide to start a blog in either English or Italian, I'll read it. I don't care about the topic. Start a blog, write something, [send it to me](mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com), and I'll read it. And you'll have your first reader. If you add an RSS feed to your blog, I'll add you to my reading list, and I'll keep reading what you post.

I think the internet would be a more interesting place if more people blogged, no matter if it was about a specific subject, personal experiences, or just their thoughts. So I'd like to join in on this, and say, that I too will read it.

If you want another reader for your blog, [send it to me](mailto:me@chrishannah.me), I'll read it.
