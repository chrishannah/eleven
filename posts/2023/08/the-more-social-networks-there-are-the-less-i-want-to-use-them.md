title: The More Social Networks There Are the Less I Want to Use Them
---

There's been an influx of new[^1] social networks recently, such as Threads,
Mastodon, and Bluesky. And to some extent, I've tried to keep up with them. But
if anything, I've noticed that my use of social media, in general, has been
dropping.

I used to use Twitter for talking about everything, and Instagram for posting
my photography. But then [Glass][glass] came along and for a while my *serious*
photography was going there, and then [BeReal][bereal] made me want to save a photo for
them every day. As for text content, there's been [Micro.blog][mb],
[Mastodon][mastodon], and [Threads][threads] that I've tried as alternatives to
Twitter.

However, all I tend to use now is just Instagram, Twitter/X, and Mastodon.
Instagram is where my friends and family tend to be, and that's where I post
photos of what I'm up to, and also any *real* photography. Mastodon is where
I've found a lot of tech bloggers and developers have flocked to, so I'm there
for that crowd. And I still haven't given up on Twitter/X, because I've found
it to still be the best place for current events, football content, and
a bunch of tech people are still there.
And when I say, I use these three platforms, that's not the same level as
before. I used to try and read *every* tweet in my timeline, both on Twitter
and Mastodon, and I'd spend countless hours scrolling through Instagram.

Now, I've got notifications turned off for everything, and I'd say I browse
Twitter/X slightly regularly. But I only really go on Instagram and Mastodon
now when I want to post something. I haven't found them to be good places to
browse. I get too sucked in when using Instagram, and I haven't yet cultivated
a good enough following list for me to spend a lot of time in Mastodon[^2].

I've found that right now, I'm more interested in people in the real world than
on the internet. That's not a dig at anyone I've talked to online. But it
doesn't replace talking to people in the physical world.

I think the reason why I'm preferring to write for my blog over social media,
is that it's a more biased relationship. It allows me to collect my thoughts, and
then express them in whatever form I feel fits the content and context. And
then if people want to reply in any way, they can do so via email, Mastodon, X,
etc. But, at a slower pace, and also in any which way *they* feel relevant.

The real-time speed and perceived urgency of social media are reasons why I've
stepped back from it a bit. So, if you've sent me a message online or by email,
know that I'm probably not ignoring you. I either haven't got around to
reading it yet, or I haven't yet found time to think and reply.

[^1]: Well, some aren't exactly *new*. But to a lot of people they are.
[^2]: That's definitely on me. But I'm not particularly interested in spending
    much time on it.
