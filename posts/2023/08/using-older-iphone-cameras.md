title: Using Older iPhone Cameras
---

I've been thinking about the cameras on older iPhones, and what makes people
prefer certain models, rather than whatever model is the newest.

A quick answer would be that *it's just subjective*, and we all like different
things.

But if you think about it, it's also affected by how people use cameras, what
they class as photography, and also what they expect in a photo.

From a photography point of view, it's easy to imagine that one model had
a desired focal length or aperture. And then, if you go deeper into
photography, you might be looking for certain colour reproductions,
temperatures, tones, lighting, etc. For example, I'm a fan of natural grain in
images, so I would prefer one that produces a certain type of grain.

So there's already a few different metrics that divide opinion. But on top of
that, there are a lot of people that use the iPhone's camera that aren't
photographers.

Some may want the best tool to capture memories, others might just want to
document their life, just like the clich√© of people posting photos of their
lunch to Instagram.

And in those cases, it may seem that the latest model would always be the best
answer. But that might not always be true. Recent phones tend to come with
a lof of built-in adjustments and corrections that are applied automatically to
photos. Therefore, even if you're aim is to take a photo that documents
a certain scene as accurately as possible, the "better" camera might not
actually be the best option.

It's weird to think that a *better* camera doesn't always produce better photos.
