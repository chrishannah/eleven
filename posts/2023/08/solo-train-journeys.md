title: Solo Train Journeys
---

People tend to think that I'm a bit weird, because I'm quite fond of a long
train journey. Especially when I'm travelling alone. I find it a much more
enjoyable experience than any other form of travel. 

When I think about why this might be the case, the word that immediately comes
to mind is "slow". But that's not quite the exact reason. I think it's because
the experience of a long train journey is that it *feels* slow. Not as in it
feels like it's taking too long, instead, it feels slow because the journey is
more relaxed. 

This may be just me. But when I get on a train, whether I'm trying to get
somewhere urgently like a morning commute or a long journey where there isn't
really any rush, it's like I've given myself an allocated amount of time to do
whatever I want.

Let's say you're on a 3-hour train ride. You know that you can't influence the
duration, and avoiding any possible delays, you also know the time of your
arrival. Which means, for a period of time, you're free.

You're free to spend your time reading, watching a movie, listening to music,
or even just some time to yourself to sit and think while you look out the
window. Better yet, you could do a collection of things. 

I tend to use that time to relax, listen to some music, catch up on social
media, maybe watch a video or read something, and probably a good chunk of it
is spent looking out of the window, while my mind wanders.

I may be alone in this, but a journey in a car or plane is always second best
to a train in my opinion. Especially when compared to being on a plane. The
whole ordeal of rushing to an airport, going through security, finding your
gate, and all of the waiting in between, really bugs me. 

A lot of people like to comment on how "chilled out" I am. Like it's just
a part of my personality. But I think it's more something that I've learned to
cultivate. Maybe I'm calmer than the average person, but I think it's
decisions like taking the slow option, not rushing myself, or inviting any
unneeded stress that makes the difference.
