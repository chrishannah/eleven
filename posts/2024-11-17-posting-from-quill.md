  <p>This post is confirmation that I have somehow managed to set up blog posting via the [Quill web interface](https://quill.p3k.io/editor).Â </p>
<p>
  It also means that I have enabled [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.com) correctly, and have built a Vercel function to power a micropub endpoint that creates and stores posts in the GitHub repo as Markdown files. Very interesting stuff.
  <br />

<p>Isn't the [Indie Web](https://indieweb.org) great?</p>
