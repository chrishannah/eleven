This post is confirmation that I have somehow managed to set up blog posting via the [Quill web interface](https://quill.p3k.io/editor)

It also means that I have enabled [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.com) correctly, and have built a Vercel function to power a micropub endpoint that creates and stores posts in the GitHub repo as Markdown files. Very interesting stuff.

Isn't the [Indie Web](https://indieweb.org) great?
