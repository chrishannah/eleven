<p>He also created another great collection titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/91506639/Cartoon-Fossils">Cartoon Fossils</a>&#8220;. But that&#8217;s not all, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hoodass/">following him on Instagram</a> for more of his work.</p>
