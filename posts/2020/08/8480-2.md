title: New Sofas!
---

<p>I did a bit of redecorating in the living room this afternoon. Which mainly involved switching the covers on one of our two <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/cat/vimle-series-37814/">VIMLE</a> sofas, from a mustard yellow, to a rich dark green. I must say it fits our theme pretty well, since the room features mainly grey, yellow, and green colours. Having a lot of plants also helps!</p>
<p>We moved in 18 months ago, and I’m starting to think the living room may actually be “done”.</p>
