title: No Longer Essential
---

<p><a href="https://www.essential.com/blog/essential-update">The Essential Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In October, we introduced Project GEM, a new mobile experience that our hardware, software and cloud teams have been building and testing for the past few years. Our vision was to invent a mobile computing paradigm that more seamlessly integrated with people’s lifestyle needs. Despite our best efforts, we’ve now taken Gem as far as we can and regrettably have no clear path to deliver it to customers. Given this, we have made the difficult decision to cease operations and shutdown Essential.

<p>I was intrigued when Essential first announced their phone in 2017, <a href="https://chrishannah.me/the-essential-phone/">enough to write an article about it</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to read what I wrote in that post nearly 3 years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  While I don’t think this phone will be for everybody, it’s another competitor, and that can only be a good thing for the industry.</p>
<p>  In principle I like the Essential phone, but I just can’t imagine myself switching to Android (this is a deeper problem I’ll expand upon in the future). I would of preferred it to run a separate operating system, but I do respect the amount of work that would take to build, not even thinking about the app ecosystem.</p>
<p>  However it is a step in the right direction for Android phones, which I believe was started by the Google Pixel. In my mind, android phones were all about quantity, and not necessarily being the best devices. But it’s started to take a different course, and it’s only for the best.
