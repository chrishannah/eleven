title: Text Case 2020.1
---

<p>It&#8217;s time for Text Case to receive its first update for 2020. Only a relatively small one this time, but it brings with it two new formats, and some work under the hood that should go unnoticed.</p>
<p>The new formats are quite straight forward:</p>
<p><strong>Straight Quotes</strong>. This does the opposite of the &#8220;Smart Quotes&#8221; format, and converts all curvy quotation marks to the simple straight versions.</p>
<p><strong>Slug</strong>. A bit of a weird one if you&#8217;re not already aware of what a slug is, but essentially it&#8217;s the more human-readable part of a URL that identifies what the page is. For example, a blog post will have a slug usually based on the title of the article. So this format will strip out all non-alphanumeric characters, and separate each word with a hyphen.</p>
<p>This update also contains a few extra things that shouldn&#8217;t be noticed, for example the way the UI is managed, and rounding corners, etc. It looks the same, except it&#8217;s done in a much more reliable way.</p>
<p>There is another less-than-tiny update to the UI that you <em>may</em> notice, and that is the gradients at the top of each format in the list view. These are now <em>slightly</em> more prominent.</p>

<hr />
<p>I&#8217;m guessing you would have noticed the 2020.1 version number, this is something I&#8217;m adopting from now on with all of my apps. The format will simply be YEAR.INCREMENT, where this is the first update to Text Case in 2020.</p>
<hr />
<p>The updates to Text Case have been quite small and more incremental updates recently, and that I think is down to the maturity of the app. There&#8217;s not <em>that many</em> text transformations that people do regularly enough to need it in an app such as Text Case, and there&#8217;s only a limited amount of ways you can interact with the app.</p>
<p>So until there&#8217;s an advancement in iOS/iPadOS/macOS I can take advantage of, I would expect the updates to continue being small tweaks, and the occasional new format.</p>
<p>In the mean time I should really be working out what app I&#8217;m going to be building next!</p>
