title: Turns Out Some Children Own a Smartphone
---

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51358192">Zoe Kleinman, writing for BBC News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The amount of young phone owners doubled between the ages of nine and 10, which Ofcom dubbed &#8220;the age of digital independence&#8221;.</p>
<p>  In addition, 24% of 3 and 4-year-olds had their own tablet, and 15% of them were allowed to take it to bed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to bad to me. A smartphone gives people access to the vast quantities of information available on the internet, entertainment in the forms of games, videos, etc. and also a tool for communication with their friends and parents.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s always at least one quote in these types of articles, to try and prompt a bit of outrage. Here we have one about not recognising the difference between the real world and online:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I&#8217;m conscious that for these children who have never known a world without the internet, in many respects their online and offline worlds are indistinguishable.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>And also one trying to prompt outrage at the suitability for content on the internet for children:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;We are seeing around half of 12-15 year olds saying they have seen hateful content online, and an increase in parents who are concerned about it,&#8221; said Yih-Choung Teh.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the problem is not that children have access to mobile computing devices, but rather some parents tend to think that they don&#8217;t need to control their child&#8217;s usage of such devices. You look after them in the physical world, so surely you&#8217;d expect to do the same in the digital world.</p>
<p>Back before smartphones were a thing, people grew up without constant access to the digital world. But now they are so ubiquitous, it&#8217;s obvious that more younger people will have access to smartphones, and especially the vast internet. I think the responsibility falls on the shoulders of both the parents, the education system, and also the various content platforms.</p>
<p>However, I don&#8217;t think the fact that children use the internet, means that the entire web needs to be child friendly.</p>
