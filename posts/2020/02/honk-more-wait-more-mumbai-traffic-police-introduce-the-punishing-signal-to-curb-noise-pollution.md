title: 'Honk More, Wait More: Mumbai Traffic Police Introduce the Punishing Signal
  To Curb Noise Pollution'

<p>Quaid Najmi, <a href="https://weather.com/en-IN/india/news/news/2020-02-01-honk-more-wait-more-mumbai-traffic-police-punishing-signal">writing for the India News section of The Weather Channel</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  From Friday (January 31, 2020), it has installed decibel meters at certain select but heavy traffic signals to deter the habitual honkers through a campaign named &#8216;The Punishing Signal&#8217;.</p>
<p>  Joint Police Commissioner (Traffic) Madhukar Pandey said that the decibel monitors are connected to traffic signals around the island city, and when the cacophony exceeds the dangerous 85-decibel mark due to needless honking, the signal timer resets, entailing a double waiting time for all vehicles.

<p>This is absolutely brilliant.</p>
