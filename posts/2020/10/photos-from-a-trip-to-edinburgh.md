title: Photos From a Trip to Edinburgh
---

I came back from a week trip to Edinburgh a few days ago, and while I was there I took quite a few photos.

Over 300 made it back, which was then refined by removing duplicates, blurry imags, and just bad compositions. I then spent some time in Loghtroom this evening trying to make them look even better, and I've been left with 44 photos that I'm really pleased with.

I've [uploaded them all to Flickr, and put them in a single album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/186342532@N04/albums/72157716284740168). But as usual, I thought I'd post a few of my favourites here directly:
