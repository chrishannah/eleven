title: The Winners of the 2020 Wildlife Photographer of the Year
---

Jason Kottke, [writing at Kottke.org](https://kottke.org/20/10/the-winners-of-the-2020-wildlife-photographer-of-the-year):

> The winning photographs in the 2020 Wildlife Photographer of the Year contest have been announced by the Natural History Museum in London. Photos above by Shanyuan Li, Weiwei Zeng, and Greg du Toit.

I love to see photography contents, especially wildlife and nature ones, because there's always absolutely great photos. But my problem is keeping track of the various competitions. So it's lucky that I read Kottke.org, since it seems like he rarely misses any!

Anyway, this years [Wildlife Photographer of the Year](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/wpy/gallery?tags=ed.current) photos were amazing as always.

When I look at wildlife photos I'm always struck by thinking how hard each of them would have been to capture. I like nature photography, mainly because of the focus on composition and lighting. But throwing animals in the mix must makee it infinitely more difficult.
