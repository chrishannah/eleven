title: The Differences between the iPhone 12 Mini, 12, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max
---

The differences between this years range of iPhones might not seem as apparent as they normally are. Because this time round, all four variants have the same Super Retina XDR display, A14 Bionic chip, Ultra and Wide cameras, and a few more things.

I'm currently trying to decide which model I will be going for this year, so I've been checking the Tech Spec pages a lot. I'm not sure if the difference between the 12 and the 12 Pro models are actually worth it to me, which I find as a shock. Seeing as usually I'm attracted to the biggest and best.

While going to the specs, I did put together a table of the differences between the four models. I don't think I've missed anything, but if I have please let me know. And note that it isn't simply a list of every detail about the phones, _only_ the ones that differ.
