title: Which Emoji Scissors Close
---

<p><a href="https://wh0.github.io/2020/01/02/scissors.html">Here&#8217;s an interesting bit of Emoji research</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Ah, scissors. They’re important enough that we have an emoji for them. On your device, it appears as ✂️. Unlike the real world tool it represents, the emoji’s job is to convey the idea, especially at small sizes. It doesn’t need to be able to swing or cut things. Nevertheless, let’s judge them on that irrelevant criterion.
