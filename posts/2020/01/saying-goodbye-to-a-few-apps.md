title: Saying Goodbye to a Few Apps
---

<p>I&#8217;ve been talking about this for a few years, but refining my App Store offerings has always been a target of mine. And today I&#8217;m taking another bit of action on that.</p>
<p>Which means my list of 8 products on the respective App Stores will go from 8 down to 5, by retiring Pretty Regular Expressions for macOS and iOS, and Tap Gap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text Case iOS/iPadOS</li>
<li>Text Case macOS</li>
<li>Pixels Sticker Pack (iMessage Sticker Pack)</li>
<li>SOLID &#8211; Wallpaper Generator</li>
<li>Qwiki</li>
<li><strike>Pretty Regular Expressions iOS</strike></li>
<li><strike>Pretty Regular Expressions macOS</strike></li>
<li><strike>Tap Gap &#8211; Fast Paced Accuracy Game</strike></li>
</ul>
<p>The reasons behind the three of them are slightly different but are essentially due to a lack of focus from myself, and a desire to not have any lingering apps anymore. Especially if I feel like they&#8217;re offering a substandard experience.</p>
<p>Pretty Regular Expressions is an app that is arguably still useful, but I haven&#8217;t used it myself in quite some time, and it&#8217;s fallen way behind its competitors on both platforms. And it&#8217;s just in a good state, it hasn&#8217;t really been adapted to the new devices over the years, and there&#8217;s tons of work needed to bring it back to a good level. There&#8217;s still a chance that I&#8217;ll revive this in the future, as I plan on working on a fresh app this year, but I can&#8217;t make any promises.</p>
<p>And for Tap Gap, this is a really simple game that I made while at university. It&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t ever a great game, and it was last updated December 2016, so I&#8217;m not even sure it works on the new devices. That was an easy decision.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also question marks over my solid colour wallpaper app, SOLID, and my Wikipedia Menu Bar app for Mac, Qwiki. However, these still function correctly and attract new users.</p>
<p>That leaves me with arguably one active product, Text Case, since the macOS app is built with Catalyst, meaning it&#8217;s essentially one codebase. And three passive products with the sticker pack, Qwiki, and SOLID.</p>
