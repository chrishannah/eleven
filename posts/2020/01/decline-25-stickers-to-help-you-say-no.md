title: Decline - 25 Stickers To Help You Say No
---

<p>I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve purchased many iMessage Sticker packs since they were added way back in iOS 10, but <a href="https://www.timothybuck.me">Timothy Buck</a> let me know about <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1493103492">Decline</a>, a sticker pack made in partnership with his wife, <a href="https://www.alyssaguerrero.com">Alyssa Guerrero</a>, and it&#8217;s pretty great.</p>
<p>With it, comes 25 different ways to say &#8216;No&#8217;.</p>

<p>A simple &#8216;Nah&#8217; or &#8216;Pass&#8217; may sometimes suffice, but maybe you want to show your disgust with &#8216;Ugh no&#8217;, or the mysterious &#8216;I must decline for secret reasons&#8217;. Either way, they&#8217;re pretty funny!</p>
<p>They&#8217;re <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1493103492">available to purchase on the App Store</a>, and if you want to get physical, you can <a href="https://www.alyssaguerrero.com/decline-shop">purchase physical stickers too</a>.</p>
<p>Timothy also <a href="https://vimeo.com/382496855">shared a video showing the lettering process</a>, so you can see how the individual stickers are made.</p>
