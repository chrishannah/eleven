title: The Lopifit "Electric Walking Bike"
---

<p>I just came across <a href="https://lopifitus.com">this product</a> via an Instagram post, and I just <em>had</em> to share it. I just can&#8217;t stop laughing about it.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrishannah.me/images/2020/07/2_bikes_coats_college.png" alt="Caption" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bike that&#8217;s designed for exercise. Specifically high-cardio workouts. But instead of just making a normal bike that people can read, they&#8217;ve taken out the seat and pedals, and put a treadmill in the middle! So it&#8217;s not an &#8220;electric walking bike&#8221; like they claim, it&#8217;s a treadmill scooter. Which now I think about it, is no better than just walking!</p>
<p>Who even comes up with these ideas?</p>
