<p>Okay, so this website is great.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="https://window-swap.com">WindowSwap</a>, as as you may have already guessed, it&#8217;s a window into other peoples&#8230; windows.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a brilliant idea. And I&#8217;ve already been watching the videos out of various peoples windows. I&#8217;ve seen windows from all over the UK, India, Israel, Germany, Finland, and I&#8217;m going to watch some more now.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking it&#8217;s just going to be a website where you just click through random badly taken photos out of peoples windows, then you&#8217;ll certainly be surprised. The videos on WindowSwap are 10-minute HD videos, which I assume go through some amount of compression, and it depends on your connection as to what quality you see.</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;ve noticed, is that I havenâ€™t been fond of any views from windows in England. it seems there&#8217;s much better views everywhere else in the world.</p>
