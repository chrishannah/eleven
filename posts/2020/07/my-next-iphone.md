title: My Next iPhone
---

<p>I was having a think recently about the next iPhone, and seeing as I&#8217;m going to upgrade this time, I thought I&#8217;d write an article about what I want personally in a new iPhone. I&#8217;ve been pondering it for quite some time, and I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s mostly the same as it was two years ago.</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery improvements</li>
<li>More colour options for the mainstream phone (I&#8217;m not going back to LCD)</li>
<li>Better front camera</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the usual stuff that we all expect every year like a faster processor, better camera, etc. But mostly I don&#8217;t actually care about that!</p>
<p>However, if it was an ideal scenario, I think I&#8217;d like a high-end iPhone that had a white case with a black front, maybe some coloured accents like the Pixel, multiple day battery life, 4K front camera, and not much else.</p>
