<p>Another small update to Text Case is hitting the App Stores.</p>
<p>It comes with a few UI enhancements, notably to help show pointer location when hovering. And also a simple context menu that appears when you right click or long press on any formatted text, where you can choose to either copy or share the result.</p>

<p>Improvements were also made to the performance of the app, and a few miscellaneous bugs were also fixed.</p>
