title: 'Coronavirus: Serco Apologises for Sharing Contact Tracers'' Email Addresses'
---

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52732818">Ross Hawkins, writing for BBC News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers.</p>
<p>The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government.</p>
<p>It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training.</p>
<p>Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes &#8220;to make sure that this does not happen again&#8221;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems like this is a simple case of someone not knowing how email works, and has either put all 300 addresses in the &#8216;To&#8217; or &#8216;CC&#8217; field.</p>
