title: Supporting Well-Being With Guides on Instagram
---

<p><a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/supporting-well-being-with-instagram-guides/">Instagram Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want Instagram to be a place where you can easily find reliable information and inspiration from your favorite accounts. That’s why we are introducing Guides, a way to more easily discover recommendations, tips and other content from your favorite creators, public figures, organizations and publishers on Instagram.</p>
<p>We know many people are struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so we are first focusing Guides on wellness content. We’ll enable creators to connect with expert organizations to share resources during this time, including tips on how to look after your well-being, maintaining connection with others or managing anxiety or grief. To view a Guide, visit the profile of participating creators or organizations like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/afspnational/">@afspnational</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/heads_together/?hl=en">@heads_together</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vitaalere/">@vitaalere</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/klicksafe/">@klicksafe</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/headspace_aus/">@headspace_aus</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/deepikapadukone/">@deepikapadukone</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/SudahDong/">@sudahdong</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eenfance/">@eenfance</a>. Then, tap the middle icon to view their Guides. In the coming days, you’ll also be able to access Guides within the Explore tab.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not into this type of content myself, but I <em>am</em> intrigued by the idea of having guides on Instagram in general.</p>
<p>There could be a whole host of ways that the medium could be used, and it would be very beneficial to have that kind of content on Instagram. Seeing as it will certainly mean more people spending their time in the app.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, tweeted alongside the announcement with the fact that <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1262456785874477063?s=21">the feature was originally designed with the idea of travel in mind</a>. Which is what I&#8217;d expect to be a very popular use case for such a feature. However, since the pandemic happened, they pivoted quickly to adapt it to the wellness market.</p>
