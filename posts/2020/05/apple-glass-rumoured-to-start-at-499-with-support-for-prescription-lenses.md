<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/19/apple-glasses-price-prescription-lenses-rumors/">Joe Rossignol, writing for MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Front Page Tech host and leaker Jon Prosser today shared several alleged details about Apple&#8217;s rumored augmented reality glasses, including an &#8220;Apple Glass&#8221; marketing name, $499 starting price, prescription lens option, and more.</p>
<ul>
<li>The marketing name will be &#8220;Apple Glass&#8221;</li>
<li>The glasses will start at $499 with the option for prescription lenses at an extra cost</li>
<li>There will be displays in both lenses that can be interacted with using gestures</li>
<li>The glasses will rely on a paired iPhone, similar to the original Apple Watch</li>
<li>An early prototype featured LiDAR and wireless charging</li>
<li>Apple originally planned to unveil the glasses as a &#8220;One More Thing&#8221; surprise at its iPhone event in the fall, but restrictions on in-person gatherings could push back the announcement to a March 2021 event</li>
<li>Apple is targeting a late 2021 or early 2022 release</li>
</ul>

<p>This product has been rumoured for years now, and it&#8217;s interesting to hear that they were apparently planned to be announced this year along side the next iPhone announcement. So they&#8217;re starting to feel like a possibility.</p>
<p>I used to think that this was a product that I would avoid. But to be honest, if they do cost around $499, and I can get my prescription lenses, then I think I would get them.</p>
