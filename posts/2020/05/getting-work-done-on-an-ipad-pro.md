<p>Depending on who you ask, you&#8217;ll get a completely different answer to the age old question of: &#8216;Can you get real work done on an iPad?&#8217; I&#8217;m not here to answer that question for you, but I have moved my own use case for my beloved iPad Pro to the next level recently, and I wanted to share a few thoughts about the software, and hardware, that has helped me along the way.</p>
