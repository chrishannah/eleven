title: Speed Test by CloudFlare
---

<p>I just came across a new speed test tool (<a href="https://thenewsprint.co/links/2020/05/26/cloudflare-s-new-internet-speed-test-tool/">via The Newsprint</a>), and it&#8217;s certainly the most detailed and responsive one I&#8217;ve seen.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s made by CloudFlare, and has the simple name of  <a href="speed.cloudflare.com">Speed Test</a>. You can find it at <a href="speed.cloudflare.com">speed.cloudflare.com</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike Speedtest.net, it loads instantly, and there&#8217;s no delay until your internet connection is tested. Which is something that always annoyed me when visiting Speedtest.net.</p>
<p>The speed or instantaneous testing aren&#8217;t the only benefits. It&#8217;s also packed full of data. Have a look at my <a href="https://chrishannah.me/images/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-29-at-22.44.42.png">screenshot below</a>, to see the type of stuff you can test.</p>

<p>(You may worry that I&#8217;ve shared my location. Rest assured that this data isn&#8217;t even close to being accurate.)</p>
