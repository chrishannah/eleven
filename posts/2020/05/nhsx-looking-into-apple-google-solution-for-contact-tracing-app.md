title: NHSX Looking Into Apple/Google Solution for Contact Tracing App
---

<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d44beb06-5e3e-434f-a3a0-f806ce06576c">Tim Bradshaw, Sarah Neville, and Helen Warrell, writing at Financial Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Health chiefs in the UK have tasked a team of software developers to “investigate” switching its unique contact-tracing app to the global standard proposed by Apple and Google, signalling a potential about-turn just days after the NHS launched its new coronavirus app.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe they&#8217;re finally getting the message, that their custom solution will not work? Just like I mentioned before?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the only bit of news from this article though, with more details emerging on the app. That is it being developed by a Swiss IT development company named &#8220;Zuhlke Engineering&#8221;, with a 6-month contract worth £3.8m.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re said to be doing this as a two-week time boxed technical spike. Which is basically a period of time allocated to evaluate a new technology/implementation. Then after the spike (evaluation) is complete, more work can be planned, estimated, and carried out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just glad they&#8217;re open to switching to the more practical Apple/Google implementation.</p>
