title: The Miracle Sudoku
---

<p>A few days ago, I kept seeing <a href="https://twitter.com/benorlin/status/1262097247866683393">a tweet</a> regarding some kind of impressive sudoku puzzle. I was mildly interested, but not enough to trigger me to watch a 25 minute video. Then I saw <a href="https://kottke.org/20/05/solving-the-the-miracle-sudoku">Jason Kottke write about it</a>, and that was then <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/05/20/miracle-sudoku">linked to by John Gruber</a>. And as I had some free time tonight, I decided to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1370&amp;v=yKf9aUIxdb4&amp;feature=emb_title">give it a watch</a>.</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yKf9aUIxdb4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>
<p>As soon as I saw that minimal sudoku board, I was intrigued. It had a single 1, and a single 2. And from that, somehow you could complete it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just a normal sudoku puzzle though, there are two extra rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any two cells separated by a knight&#8217;s move or a king&#8217;s move (in chess) cannot contain the same digit.</li>
<li>Any two orthogonally adjacent cells cannot contain consecutive digits.</li>
</ol>
<p>After about 4 minutes into the video, the rules were explained, and I just had to try this myself. So I paused the video, and found <a href="https://cracking-the-cryptic.web.app/sudoku/tjN9LtrrTL">the link to the puzzle</a>. And after around 45 minutes (A rough estimate as I was doing other things at the same time), I finally did it. It truly is a fantastic sudoku.</p>
<p>I still had to watch the rest of the video though, and it was totally worth it. You watch him start with a seemingly impossible puzzle, which he starts to make progress on, and then suddenly it clicks. A fascinating thing to watch.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1357&amp;v=yKf9aUIxdb4&amp;feature=emb_title">Watch the video on YouTube</a>, and if you want, <a href="https://cracking-the-cryptic.web.app/sudoku/tjN9LtrrTL">try the puzzle for yourself</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now going to see if I can find some more puzzles I can do!</p>
