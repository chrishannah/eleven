title: Why I "Force" Quit Apps
---

<p>Ever since you could open the multitasking interface on iOS, you&#8217;ve able to &#8220;force&#8221; quit apps. And not long after that, there&#8217;s always been people telling you that you shouldn&#8217;t, and that it was bad practice.</p>
<p>Most of the time these people will use the reasoning that having an app running in the background, doesn&#8217;t actually use up your memory or battery, and that that&#8217;s clearly why people are doing it. Others will say that resuming an app from the background is less CPU intensive than launching it from scratch. And there&#8217;s even the argument that it&#8217;s a waste of your time.</p>
<p>Even in Apple&#8217;s guide how to close an app has the prefix &#8220;How to force an app to close&#8221;, and in the guide, it tells you to do that &#8220;You should force an app to close only if itâ€™s unresponsive&#8221;. So it&#8217;s not something they really endorse doing</p>
<hr />
<p>So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going to explain the main reasons why I <strong>do</strong> quit apps on my iPhone and iPad.</p>
<h2>Clutter</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s the same as why I like to have a tidy desktop on my Mac and organised home screens on my iPhone and iPad. I don&#8217;t want clutter on my devices. And I find it irritating when I see apps that I&#8217;m not using when I open the app switcher.</p>
<h2>It Helps To Signify the End of a Task</h2>
<p>Similar to my disgust about the clutter, it helps to signify when I&#8217;ve stopped using an app.</p>
<p>For example, if I&#8217;ve been writing on my iPad, I&#8217;ve probably got iA Writer open, maybe Safari for research, Agenda for my overall planner, and even Reeder where I&#8217;m reading articles I want to write about. When I then finish writing, I&#8217;ll close all of these apps at once, and I no longer have to think about writing, until I actually want to start writing again.</p>
<h2>What Does the Opposite Look Like?</h2>
<p>Fine, let&#8217;s look at the opposite. What&#8217;s going to happen if you never quit apps on your devices? Well, one thing&#8217;s for sure, you&#8217;re going to have a lot of apps open.</p>
<p>I have 97 apps installed on my phone. So if I was to never quit an app, then by the end of a week, I&#8217;d expect to have quite a large number of them open. And eventually, surely the expectation is that every single application will be running?</p>
<p>Maybe there&#8217;s not much difference in battery level of memory usage when you&#8217;ve got a few apps in standby. But surely there&#8217;s got to be a difference at some point?</p>
<p>Either way, there&#8217;s certainly one place where you&#8217;ll see a difference. The app switcher. Imagine having 50 apps open, and you&#8217;re trying to find an app that just happens to be at the beginning of the list. That&#8217;s bound to be irritating.</p>
<p>Maybe the answer to that, is that if you do have 50 apps open at once, then the app switcher isn&#8217;t the place where you&#8217;d actually launch them from. Since having every installed app running and visible in the app switcher is essentially a giant home screen. In which case the app switcher becomes pointless.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s the Alternative?</h2>
<p>Finally, the last reason why I &#8220;force&#8221; quit my apps, is because there is no alternative.</p>
<p>No matter what the system does in the background to running apps, they are still open. They are not closed.</p>
<p>Therefore, seeing as there&#8217;s no &#8220;nice way&#8221; to quit apps, I force quit them.</p>
<hr />
<p>I&#8217;m aware that this topic might be unpopular, and there&#8217;s a good chance that you might think that quitting apps is plain stupid.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just leave you with one question:</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a task that shouldn&#8217;t be done frequently, then why is it so easy and accessible to do?</p>
