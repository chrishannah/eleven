title: Simulating the Spread of Infections
---

<p>One of my favourite YouTube Channels, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ">Primer</a>, has a new simulation video. This time it focusses on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OLpKqTriio">simulating the different phases of infections</a>, and tracking how various factors such as population size, infection rate, and infected duration affect the simulation.</p>
<p>I found it rather fascinating, and I would definitely recommend watching the video. Although, it&#8217;s not specifically a COVID-19 simulation, or even meant to exactly represent real-life. So don&#8217;t look at the results and expect a perfect with the current COVID-19 situation.</p>
