title: What I Want To See From Apple's 'Time Flies' Event
---

<p>Apple&#8217;s next event is just around the corner and seeing as it&#8217;s very much expected that the event will focus on the Apple Watch. Which, alongside journalists, is suggested by the name of the event, &#8216;Time Flies&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch has certainly been a strange product for me. I had the very first model, and <a href="https://chrishannah.me/the-original-apple-watch-is-a-steady-favourite/">absolutely loved it</a>. I eventually bought a series 3, and I was certainly still enjoying using it. But that all changed at the start of this year, when <a href="https://chrishannah.me/ive-taken-my-watch-off/">I stopped wearing it completely</a>. I <a href="https://chrishannah.me/8398-2/">tried to start wearing it again</a> recently, this time with no notifications, or third-party apps, but it still wasn&#8217;t a product that I wanted in my life anymore.</p>
<p>But for a while now, there has been a similar product that I&#8217;ve had in mind, that I <em>would</em> like from Apple. And that would be a smart band. Not a smartwatch. There are tons of smart bands available now, and they all have their own collection of features, whether it&#8217;s fitness tracking, receiving phone calls, listening to music, etc. But I want one from Apple. Partially because I&#8217;m a big fan of Apple products, but also because I&#8217;m heavily invested in the ecosystem. And any other smart band might have the features I want in principle, but it probably won&#8217;t ever be as integrated as something that Apple could make themselves.</p>
<p>Essentially, I want an Apple Watch, but without nearly everything that comes with the Apple Watch. I don&#8217;t want a big screen, third-party apps, notifications, or ability to make phone calls. Ideally, the benefit of this product would be that it wouldn&#8217;t be directly used. I want a device that acts as a constant health and fitness sensor, and feeds that data back to my other devices, whether it&#8217;s directly to my iPhone, or even with its own connect to iCloud.</p>
<p>In total, these are the features that I want this ideal product to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Takes form as a strap/bracelet, that&#8217;s around the same size as a typical smart band. </li>
<li>A small display used to show time, date, and maybe a few small health metrics such as heart rate. </li>
<li>Ability to upload data via nearby devices, or via a WiFi connection.</li>
<li>Long battery life.</li>
</ul>
<p>It could be that this product is so &#8220;basic&#8221;, that there&#8217;s no reason why Apple would create such a device. But there&#8217;s certainly a market for it. Call it the Apple Watch Mini, or the Apple Watch Strap for all I care. I just want a smart band, that&#8217;s designed and built by Apple, that works perfectly with my other Apple devices.</p>
<p>Apart from that dream device. I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m that excited about anything else from the event. Unless they give hints about the next iPhone or do something unexpected of course. There&#8217;s a lot of rumours regarding a new iPad, but my mind is set on a new iPad Pro, so I assume I&#8217;ll have to wait a little longer for that.</p>
