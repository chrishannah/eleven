title: The Apple Watch Series 6
---

<p>I&#8217;ll start with the fact that I&#8217;ve not been the Apple Watch&#8217;s biggest fan for a while. I&#8217;ve used a Series 0 and Series 3, but for quite a few months <a href="https://chrishannah.me/ive-taken-my-watch-off/">I&#8217;ve been watch free</a>.</p>
<p>In my ideal scenario, I&#8217;d like Apple to offer a smart band instead of a full watch. But I&#8217;ve come to terms that it&#8217;s probably not going to happen any time soon. And in a weird U-turn, I ended up ordering a Series 6 yesterday in size 10<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The watch I ordered was a 44mm Space Grey Aluminium one with a Charcoal Braided Solo Loop. And it was because of a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The new blood oxygen sensor</strong>. Maybe not impressive on its own, but I think having that <em>and</em> the heart rate monitor, the health/fitness capabilities will increase massively.</li>
<li><strong>watchOS 7</strong>. I haven&#8217;t had a good look at watchOS 7 before this event, and I was really surprised to see how good it was. Especially the new watch faces. (Matt Birchler has <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/watchos-7-the-birchtree-review/">a great review on watchOS 7</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Going back to work</strong>. A big reason why I <em>stopped</em> wearing the watch was because of the lockdown, and that I was no longer commuting to work anymore. Well, I&#8217;m going to have to start again soon, and I used my watch a ton while on the way or at work.</li>
<li><strong>The new straps</strong>. The new Loop and Braided Loop straps are really nice. I found it really annoying that the buckle of the Sports Loop always dug into my wrist, so that&#8217;s definitely a good thing.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s a decent upgrade</strong>. As my last watch was the Series 3, the changes over the past three years have added up to become quite a large improvement. So I&#8217;m just generally interested in what an Apple Watch can do for me now.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want more information on the new watch strap sizes, I did <a href="https://chrishannah.me/apple-watch-strap-sizes/">a tiny bit of investigation</a>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
