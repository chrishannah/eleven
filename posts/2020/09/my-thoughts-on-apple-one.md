title: My Thoughts on Apple One
---

<p>A lot of people have been crying out for a single Apple subscription for quite some time now, and we&#8217;ve finally got one. It&#8217;s totally the right time for such a bundle. Especially with the new Fitness+ service coming soon. As Apple have been able to create three different plans with up to six different services.</p>
<p>I think the way they&#8217;ve split the plans make sense. One for the user that wants the fundamental services of music, television, and games. The same but for families. And one <strong>big</strong> plan for people that simply want everything. And they&#8217;re all topped off with different amounts of iCloud storage.</p>
<p>The iCloud storage probably won&#8217;t be one that draws people in, but I think people will definitely see the benefit of the extra storage once they use it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;m going to be doing myself regarding Apple One. Because right now I pay for Apple Music, tv+, and 200 GB of iCloud storage. The 200 GB costs £2.49 a month, tv+ costs £4.99 a month, and I still somehow get student discount, so I pay only £4.99 for Apple Music. A total of £12.47. Less than any of the Apple One plans.</p>
<p>Maybe if I lose the Apple Music discount, then it would make sense. But I&#8217;d also have to pay extra for higher iCloud storage. I was hoping that I could use a bundle to try out News+, but £29.95 seems a bit much for my usage. Because I certainly won&#8217;t be using Fitness+, and I&#8217;ve already cancelled my Apple Arcade subscription because I wasn&#8217;t playing any of the games.</p>
