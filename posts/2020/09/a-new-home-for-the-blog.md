title: A New Home for the Blog
---

As of right now, this blog has been moved away from the previous subdomain `chrishannah.me` and simply on `chrishannah.me`. I've wanted to make that switch for a while now, but it didn't seem worthwhile on its own.

However, along with the domain switch, I've migrated the blog from WordPress to Ghost. That won't matter to most people, and I don't expect it to either. But basically, it means the blog is much more lightweight, and I can provide a few extra things like estimated reading time, primary tags above the post to help contextualise, and a few other technical things that only I care about. I think WordPress could achieve everything that Ghost can do, but it comes with a lot of baggage.

Anyway, enough of that.

The only thing that has changed from a reader point of view is the new domain (Or lack of subdomain). I have set up 301 redirects, so if you do visit the old URL, you will be redirected to the new version. However, it's obviously not a permanent solution.

That also means that the old RSS feed will still work, while the redirects are still there. But just to make sure you don't have any issues, the new RSS feed is: [chrishannah.me/feed](https://chrishannah.me/feed).

While I'm pretty sure everything has migrated over, and it's all working fine. If you see anything odd, please [let me know](https://twitter.com/chrishannah).
