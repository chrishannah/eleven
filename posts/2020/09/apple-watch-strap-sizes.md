title: Apple Watch Strap Sizes
---

<p>The new Apple Watch Series 6 is here (I&#8217;ve already ordered mine). But before I write up my thoughts on everything that was announced, I thought I&#8217;d play around with the sizes for the new watch straps, seeing as the new Solo Loop and Braided Solo Loop come in 9 sizes (Although the size guide has 12?). Mainly because I wanted to see if I see any interesting trends, but also, why not?</p>
<p>So it turns out that it&#8217;s not as simple as having a representative &#8220;Apple&#8221; size for a range of measurements. Instead, there are ranges for every strap size, and also one specific millimetre-precise measurement for every strap size that has two &#8220;fits&#8221;. A precise fit, which they say is for active lifestyles, and a relaxed fit for everyday use. They always recommend the precise fit.</p>
<p>Here are how wrist sizes relate to the new strap size:</p>

<p>As you can see the sizes span from 12.6 cm to 20.6 cm. But the Loop Solo and Braided Loop Solo only come in sizes 3 to 12, so the sizes are actually from 13.9 cm to 20.6 cm. If your wrist is smaller or bigger, you&#8217;re going to have to find another strap.</p>
<p>While that data is interesting (and maybe useful), I wondered if I could find anything else from the data. So I flipped the columns and simplified the data to represent a precise fit as being inclusive in the relevant sizes.</p>

<p>To be honest, I didn&#8217;t see anything useful here. But I did work out that the first two sizes have a range of 0.7 cm, the next 3 sizes have a range of 0.6 cm, and the latter 7 have a range of 0.7 cm. I had a theory that the bigger the strap is, it makes sense that it would be able to stretch to a larger size. But I was expecting to see a higher variability.</p>
