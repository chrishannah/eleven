title: Blue Hour with Jay
---

<p>I was just out in my garden with my cat, Jay, seeing as that’s as far as I can go at the moment. But he was walking up and down one of the fences, so I decided to grab my camera<a href="1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> and take a few shots of him.</p>
<p>What I’ve now learned, is that I really like the colours at this time of night. Or more specifically as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_hour">blue hour</a>, (as opposed to the more commonly known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_(photography)">golden hour</a>), which happens in the twilight ether just before sunrise or just after sunset when the sky has a really blue tint.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s a good enough excuse for me to post some photos here on my blog. Enjoy.</p>
