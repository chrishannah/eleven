title: Combining Screenshots with Picsew
---

<p>When writing about apps, it’s very common that you’ll need to combine  screenshots together if you’re trying to capture a rather long page. One common case of this is when you’re trying to capture a screenshot of a Shortcut, which is why I looked for an app like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/picsew-screenshot-stitching/id1208145167?uo=4)">Picsew</a>, when I was getting screenshots for my recent article about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/how-im-using-shortcuts-and-data-jar-to-help-write-link-posts/">how I’m using Data Jar to help writing link posts</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve used apps like Tailor or LongScreen before, but I found LongScreen to be hard to deal with, and Tailor only support the iPhone. So I explored the App Store trying to find a solution for the iPad, and luckily I found Picsew.</p>
<p>Similar to the previously mentioned apps, Picsew has the ability to automatically combine multiple pictures together. But it didn’t seem to work well with the screenshots I took of some shortcuts. This is where the more “manual” option comes in. And I think that option is actually much more impressive than the automatic feature.</p>
<p>So after you select the photos you want to combine (in the correct order), and choose either vertical or horizontal, you use a pretty cool editor to adjust the position of each screenshot where you wish it to join the next one.</p>
<p>It’s quite intuitive actually, and was much easier than I thought it would be. You just tap on the join you wish to exit, and “push” the content towards the join until you’re happy.</p>

<p>You can also crop the entire photo inside the app as well, which is pretty handy as when you get a pretty large photo, it’s hard to do fine adjustments in the Photos app.</p>

<p>Anyway, I found it to be a very handy utility. So if you’re looking for an app that can join various photos together, or if you’ve used another one previously, I’d recommend checking out Picsew.</p>
