title: This Fantastical Sea Creature Helps Remove Planet-Warming Gases From the Atmosphere

<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-07/deep-sea-mucus-larvacean">Rosanna Xia, writing for the LA Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was decades ago when Bruce Robison first looked through the plexiglass sphere of a submersible and spotted a most curious critter in the waters off Central California.</p>
<p>Nearly transparent and no larger than a fist, the squishy tadpole-like animal was surrounded by an enormous balloon of mucus about 3 feet wide. Robison could discern chambers intricately inflated within this sticky structure, speckled with particles of food and plant debris.</p>
<p>Robison spent years in the open ocean studying these gelatinous animals, which are too large and too fragile to bring back into a lab. Known as giant larvaceans, they inhabit seas across the world. Tens of thousands of them live just outside Robison’s office in Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>He and fellow researchers eventually learned that these creatures and their snot palaces play an outsize role in helping the ocean remove planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere — one more part of a vast and underappreciated system that makes the ocean an unsung hero of climate change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some truly fascinating creatures in the ocean, and the giant larvacean is certainly one of those. Who would have thought that something so small could grow that big?</p>
<p>Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wFb_ShW7k">video by Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute</a> to get a proper look at what the giant larvacean, Bathochordaeus, looks like.</p>
