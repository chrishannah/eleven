title: Random Prnt.sc
---

<p>Okay, so I was bored today, and that led to me building a website. Specifically one that lets you find random images that are hosted on <a href="https://chrishannah.me/prntsc">Prnt.sc</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Background Information</strong></p>
<p>Basically, there&#8217;s a screenshot utility called Lightshot, and it has the option to upload your images to the web. is a screenshot utility that allows you to quickly customise screenshots, and upload them to the internet. These images can be found on a website called Prnt.sc, and they&#8217;re publicly available.</p>
<p>In fact, all you need in order to find an image on Prnt.sc is a 6-digit alphanumeric identifier. Which is easily generated.</p>

<p>This afternoon I was playing around with random combinations, trying to find anything amusing. But I&#8217;m a lazy person, so I try to make any manual process easier.</p>
<p>My first idea was to somehow built a simple website that could actually find images from Prnt.sc, and display them inline. However, due to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">cross-origin resource sharing</a>, it seemed way to complex for a fun afternoon project. So I settled on simply generating random identifiers, and opening a them in new tabs.</p>
<hr />
<p>The website is now live, and you can view it at <a href="https://chrishannah.me/prntsc">chrishannah.me/prntsc</a>. And it comes, as I mention in the footer of the page, &#8220;built with minimal style&#8221;.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure what type of aesthetic this is, but it always reminds me of the purities of the web. I much prefer a website that has well structured HTML, and little to no CSS. I mean, I didn&#8217;t even add any styles to links, and it still looks good!</p>
<p>Sometimes I want to just change my blog completely to a static site, with a super basic design. But I&#8217;ll leave that to another day.</p>
