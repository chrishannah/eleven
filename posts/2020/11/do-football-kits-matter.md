title: Do Football Kits Matter?
---

Over on the [Tifo Football channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGYYNGmyhZ_kwBF_lqqXdAQ), [Ben Jacobs investigated whether different football kits can have an affect on the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pokzACZ6JxY).

It's just a short video, at just over 7 minutes, but he certainly goes into a lot more detail than I imagined. I thought it would just be statistics from the top performing football teams over the years, and then trying to spot a pattern with the kit colours.

He does touch on stats like red being the best performing shirt colour in the Premier League, but that's most likely due to the fact that the three biggest clubs in the UK wear red (Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal). But the section that interested me the most was the goalkeeper shirt colour, and that apparently red is also the best colour in that regard. But in that case it seems to be backed up information, rather than just consequential statistics.
