title: The MagSafe Wallet on Each Size iPhone
---

If you had any thoughts on how the MagSafe Wallet would like like on each iPhone, then [Greg Morris has you covered](https://gr36.com/magsafe-wallet-each-size-iphone/):

> Yeah, I'm that guy this year. I couldn't decide which iPhone size I wanted, so I got them all. It's a weird position to be in but also provides me with some deeper insights into the real differences. I am not talking about specs and all those kinds of figures that people get too caught up in, the real things that make a difference to actually using the device. One of the strangest ones I have had to think about this year is the MagSafe wallet — so here is how it fits with each size iPhone.

I think the MagSafe wallet pairs really well with the new iPhones. It seems to fit all sizes without looking out of place, and also it’s a perfect item to be used with MagSafe.

After seeing Greg’s article, and his video showing the unboxing and answering a few questions, I think I’ll hold off buying one for now. I use a very small card wallet right now anyway, and only use 2 cards, so it seemed like a good fit for me. But seeing as the magnets aren’t as strong as I expected, and you still need to detach the wallet from the iPhone to use it. I think I’ll just wait and see.

Here is Greg’s video on the wallet:
