title: Mac Mini Teardown Provides Real-World Look at M1 Chip on Smaller Logic Board

[Joe Rossignol, writing for MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/18/apple-silicon-mac-mini-teardown/):

> A teardown of the new Mac mini [has surfaced on the forum eGPU.io](https://egpu.io/forums/desktop-computing/teardown-late-2020-mac-mini-apple-silicon-m1-thunderbolt-4-usb4-pcie-4/) (via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/jw66pv/teardown_late_2020_mac_mini_apple_silicon_m1/)), providing us with a real-world look at Apple's new M1 chip, which is soldered onto a much smaller logic board than the one found in the 2018 model of the computer.

There sure looks like there's a lot of empty space in there, which bodes well for the future. You can take it as more room for future even more powerful models, or that this power could be put into an even smaller chassis. Either way it's positive.
