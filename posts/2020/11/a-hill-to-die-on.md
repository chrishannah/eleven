title: A Hill to Die On
---

[Matt Birchler](https://birchtree.me/blog/a-hill-to-die-on/):

> Today the hill some seem to be willing to die on is that the Mac will never get a touch screen.“It sucks on Windows, Apple wouldn’t do that. They’ve said no for 10 years, why do you expect them to change?”__Optionally, bounce back to the top of this post if you’re not sure where I’m going here.__ 😋This year Apple added a mouse cursor to the iPad, something a few years ago would have been brushed off as “a Mac thing that didn’t belong on a touch-based OS.” Yet here we are. If you can find a single person who thinks the iPad is worse off for adding a cursor, I’d be very impressed. Apple didn’t just glom the Mac cursor onto the iPad and call it a day, they updated iPadOS in ways that made it work wonderfully.

This is a great piece by Matt, and I think he's managed to convince me about touch screens eventually coming to Macs.

I think I was biased by the touch implementation in Windows, which I don't think is particularly impressive, and also the difference between macOS and iOS where Apple do support touch.

But Apple adding a touch screen wouldn't be just that. There would be a story behind it. And I for one, am intrigued to see what that story will be.
