Speaking of [youtube-dl being available again](https://chrishannah.me/youtube-dl-is-back/), here is [Abby Vollmer over on the GitHub blog on the matter](https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/):

> Today we reinstated [youtube-dl,](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) a popular project on GitHub, after we received [additional information](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/11/2020-11-16-RIAA-reversal-effletter.pdf) about the project that enabled us to reverse a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown.At GitHub, our priority is supporting open source and the developer community. And so we share developers’ frustration with this takedown—especially since this project has many legitimate purposes. Our actions were driven by processes required to comply with laws like the DMCA that put platforms like GitHub and developers in a difficult spot. And our reinstatement, based on new information that showed the project was not circumventing a technical protection measure (TPM), was inline with our values of putting developers first. We know developers want to understand what happened here, and want to know how GitHub will stand up for developers and refine our processes on these issues.In this post, we provide answers to common questions about the DMCA and why GitHub handled this case the way we did, describe why circumvention claims deserve special treatment, and share how we’re updating our policies and fighting to improve the law.

With all the attention being on the youtube-dl situation, it certainly is good to see GitHub be transparent about their processes regarding DMCA claims, and also anouncing some changes to their claim review process.
