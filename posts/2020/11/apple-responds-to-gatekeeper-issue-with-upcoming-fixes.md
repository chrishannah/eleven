title: Apple Responds to Gatekeeper Issue With Upcoming Fixes
---

[Romain Dillet, writing for TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/15/apple-responds-to-gatekeeper-issue-with-upcoming-fixes/?guccounter=1):

> Apple  has updated a documentation page detailing the company’s next steps to prevent last week’s Gatekeeper bug from happening again, as Rene Ritchie spotted. The company plans to implement the fixes over the next year.Apple had a difficult launch day last week. The company released macOS Big Sur, a major update for macOS. Apple then suffered from server-side issues.Third-party apps failed to launch as your Mac couldn't check the developer certificate of the app. That feature, called Gatekeeper, makes sure that you didn't download a malware app that disguises itself as a legit app. If the certificate doesn’t match, macOS prevents the app launch.

A pretty embarrassing bug for such a big day.
