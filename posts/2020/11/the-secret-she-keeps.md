title: The Secret She Keeps
---

I can’t say I’m one to write regularly about the various films and series that I watch, here on this blog. But I just finished watching a short series on BBC called [The Secret She Keeps](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p08grsgv/the-secrets-she-keeps), and although it’s only 6 episodes long, I found it rather gripping, and intriguing.

I won’t spoil the plot, but the story is about two different pregnant women come together, while major secrets in their lives start to see the light and some that are quite shocking. At a few points, the storyline can be predictable, but there’s still enough plot twists to keep you on your toes.

So while I won’t say this is a masterpiece, it’s a gripping series, that will certainly keep you entertained.

You can [watch it on BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p08grsgv/the-secrets-she-keeps).

One reason I decided to write a short post about this series is the IMDB score, it’s got just a 6.8, and for some reason, people rate it pretty low. I’ve found that with a lot of films and series that I enjoy have rather low ratings, so maybe I should start writing more about them.
