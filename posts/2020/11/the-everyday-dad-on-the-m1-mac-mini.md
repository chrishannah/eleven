title: The Everyday Dad on the M1 Mac Mini
---

The M1 Mac reviews are dropping, and I've just watched a [review of the M1 Mac Mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UliJxItLw3I) by one of my favourite YouTubers, [The Everyday Dad](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqvULRRboZeXVezSm_XduLQ). His question was "can you use this machine as your only video-editing computer?", and it turns out not only _can you_, there's every reason _to_ use this machine for video-editing.

Benchmarks are one thing, but seeing the cheapest Mac operate like this is incredible.
