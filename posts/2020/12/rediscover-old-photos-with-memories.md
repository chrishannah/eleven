title: Rediscover Old Photos With Memories
---

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photos-widget-memories/id1540852772">Memories</a> is a new app that lets you view photos from years gone by on your iOS devices, either inside of the app, or with its widgets.</p>

<p>Memories supports all three widget sizes, and they will each show a single photo from previous years. It won't just show the one photo for the whole day though, as it cycles through multiple photos throughout the day.</p>

<p>A lot of these types of apps exist, where you can go back in time and experience old memories. But personally, I know I'd never actually ever use them. That's why I like these widgets, since I can put a widget on one of my home screens, and my phone can remind me of various memories as I use it.</p>
