title: The Effect COVID Has Had on Japanese Country Towns
---

VICE Asia has produced [a great documentary regarding the effect that COVID has had on Japan’s country towns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csBr5pO_Gfk&feature=youtu.be).

For three consecutive months, the number of people that left Tokyo was greater than the number of people moving in. Which is something that hasn’t happened since 2013.

It’s interesting to see the effect COVID has had on peoples lives, with most people being able to work remotely, and in general people being stuck inside their homes.

There’s a lot to think about when it comes to what the long-lasting effects of this pandemic will be, but I’m hoping that at least something positive can come out of 2020.

My current idea is that this pandemic will be a key factor in the worlds population becoming more sparse than it is right now. Since, if you can work from home, then that removes one major reason of living in a densely populated city.

I think we’re going to see a lot of people reevaluating their priorities, and making some major changes in the next few years. Directly or indirectly, this pandemic will certainly change the way people live their lives going forward.
