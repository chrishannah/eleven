<p>Trevor Nace, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2019/02/28/nasa-says-earth-is-greener-today-than-20-years-ago-thanks-to-china-india/#67aedc36e135">writing at Forbes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  NASA has some good news, the world is a greener place today than it was 20 years ago. What prompted the change? Well, it appears China and India can take the majority of the credit.</p>
<p>  In contrast to the perception of China and India&#8217;s willingness to overexploit land, water and resources for economic gain, the countries are responsible for the largest greening of the planet in the past two decades. The two most populous countries have implemented ambitious tree planting programs and scaled up their implementation and technology around agriculture.

<p>This is very encouraging. Hopefully this is something that we can start to compete on, as it will only result in a better planet for us all.</p>
