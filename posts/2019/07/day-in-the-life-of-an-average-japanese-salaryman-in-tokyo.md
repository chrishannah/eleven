title: Day in the Life of an Average Japanese Salaryman in Tokyo
---

<p>I stumbled upon this video just now, and it immediately grabbed my attention. As for some reason, the working life of others is interesting to me, and the Japanese culture, even more so.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmjXp_AYg0">watch the video</a>, and follow Makoto through a day in his life:</p>

  Japanese work day at a Japanese office for an average Japanese salaryman in a Tokyo office.<br />
  Living in Japan and working in Japan is quite a unique experience.  This is a day in the life of Japanese worker, Makoto, 27 years old who lives in a Tokyo 3-story house with his family.<br />
  This Tokyo salaryman works in a small Tokyo office, but spends many of his Japan working hours traveling from client to client on the Tokyo trains.<br />
  Makoto works for a company called Mobal and as many Japanese salarymen, he entered the company straight from a Japanese University and he plans to spend his entire salaryman career at the same company.<br />
  That is the life in Japan for a salaryman.  We take a look inside what it&#8217;s like to work in a small Tokyo office as well as to visit clients throughout Tokyo city area.<br />
  His job experiences maybe unique to his company, but fundamentally he is very much an average salaryman.</p>
<p>  He commutes by train everyday to get to work and has to ride his mama-chari bike to get to the train station from his home.<br />
  This Tokyo salaryman life has him arriving to work early and working late.  As a salaryman, Makoto receives a standard salary every month for all the long work hours.<br />
  The Japanese office is also configured so his boss&#8217; desk is right in front of him, quite a Japanese style office working environment.  This very average Japanese work day and work lifestyle showcases a true day in Japan work life.
