title: Finding a New RSS App for Mac
---

<p>Up until today I used <a href="http://reederapp.com/mac/">Reeder 3</a>, and it’s served me well for a very long time. However, in August <a href="https://twitter.com/reederapp/status/1034821640864129026">the developer announced that Reeder 4 is being worked on</a>, and in the meantime version 3 would be free to download. I planned on waiting for the update, but there’s a few minor issues that are causing me a bit of friction. The main one being that while it supports Dark “modes” on macOS, when using actual Dark Mode on my Mac it doesn’t actually alter the whole app.</p>
<p>I started my searching via <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/1d520cc0-30bd-4d98-a50a-5465c68db456">SetApp</a>, as I already pay for that. An app called <a href="http://cappuccinoapp.com">Cappuccino</a> took my fancy, and it also had a companion for iOS, which is ideal. That lasted about 5 minutes, as I discovered it doesn’t support external RSS feed services like Feedly that I currently use, so everything is stored in that app. That wasn’t the immediate turn off though, as I could use the iOS app as well. But then I checked out a few articles, and there just wasn’t any level of user presences apart from a few themes, and things like block quotes just weren’t being displayed correctly. So that was off the table. The other option on SetApp is <a href="https://betamagic.nl/products/newsexplorer.html">News Explorer</a>, and that looked <em>okay</em>,  it also had an iOS app that I didn’t particularly like the look of.</p>
<p>So I checked out the Mac App Store (that I actually really like using), and I discovered that had already purchased a copy of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id576338668?mt=12">Leaf</a> in the past. So I’ve started using that again, and it feels good to have an app that lets me fine-tune my experience. It doesn’t seem to support macOS Dark Mode, but that is actually okay. As it supports its own themes like most other RSS readers. And unlike other apps without Dark Mode support, parts of the UI aren’t “automatically” adapted via the OS, so it doesn’t look half-baked.</p>
<p>For now I’ll keep on using Reeder on iOS, as there’s nothing there that irritates me. But that could be something I look at in the future. As there are a lot of alternatives available.</p>

<p>After having a search through my blog and past tweets, I discovered the reason why I switched to Reeder was the fact that it <em>was free</em>. It’s strange that the same reason that brought me to the app was essentially the reason I’m now leaving it behind.</p>
