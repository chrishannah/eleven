<p>Itâ€™s time for an update to Text Case! It contains four changes, and three of them were taken from user feedback! Which I really like, as it means I can tailor the app to how the app is actually being used, not an idea in my head.</p>
<p>So, here are the improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new format! Strip HTML will clear any HTML tags and any whitespace either side of the result.</li>
<li>You can now alter the order of the way formats appear in the app.</li>
<li>Pasting text via the keyboard shortcut (CMD + V) will now work even if the textfield is not selected, meaning you can get the formats much faster.</li>
<li>Any settings in the app are now synced between your devices.</li>
</ul>
