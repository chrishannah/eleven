title: Why Isn't Bamboo Wood a Bigger Worldwide Industry?
---

<p>Well, that’s the shortened version of the question that asked on Quora:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Why isn&#8217;t bamboo wood a bigger worldwide industry, since it grows so quickly and is so strong? couldn&#8217;t it replace lumber and save many trees?”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a question that I’ve often thought myself. You hear regularly about how bamboo is such a superior resource for many things, but I’ve never seen an objective reason why it’s not as widely used.</p>
<p>But in his answer, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-bamboo-wood-a-bigger-worldwide-industry-since-it-grows-so-quickly-and-is-so-strong-Couldnt-it-replace-lumber-and-save-many-trees/answer/Rapha%C3%ABl-du-Sablon?share=1">Raphaël du Sablon came to our aid with some very interesting reasons</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Okay, here is the long answer. Bamboo is the collective name for several dozen genera of grasses, all in the Bambusoideae branch of the “BOP” clade.[1] While most bamboo species are either shrubby or relatively short plants, a couple genera include particularly large species, typically called “timber bamboo” or “giant bamboo.” These are the bamboo of relevance.</p>
<p>Being in the grass family, bamboo is not a tree. Thus, material cut from bamboo stalks is not technically “wood.” Because of its roughly similar properties, however, and for marketing reasons, it often is referred to as a wood.</p>
<p>With that pedantry out of the way, let’s consider the uses of wood, and how bamboo compares. The big ones are fuel, lumber, and paper.</p></blockquote>
