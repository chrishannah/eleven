title: Photos from My Trip to Durdle Door
---

<p>Just a few weeks ago, my girlfriend and myself took a short trip to Dorset. One of the main parts of the trip was to visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durdle_Door">Durdle Door</a>. I was just going through my photos, and I picked out a few of them that I&#8217;d like to share here. All photos were taken on my iPhone XS.</p>
