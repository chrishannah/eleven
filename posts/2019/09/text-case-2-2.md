<p>There’s a new update to Text Case for me to tell everyone about!</p>
<p>It’s not exactly a huge update with tons of new features, but it’s one I think will make the use of Text Case much more efficient. I talked about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/what-text-case-is-becoming/">the way Text Case is evolving</a> recently here on the blog, but essentially the main new &#8220;feature&#8221; is the new Shortcuts action.</p>
<p>In Text Case 2.2, you&#8217;ll have just the one action in Shortcuts, and that will be able to have an input parameter for the text you wish to format, an option to select the specific format, and then it will have the formatted text as an output. Previously each format had its own action, which meant it was always a bit messy. And, of course, Shortcut actions didn&#8217;t have parameter support before, so it always relied upon the clipboard.</p>
<p>However, now you have access to one magical action that has all the functionality of Text Case. It can slot directly into any Shortcut, and then get out of your way.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t just stop there with the update. I also added a few extra new formats. You now have the option to remove all whitespace, or just trim the leading/whitespace with the new formats &#8220;Strip Whitespace&#8221; and &#8220;Trim Whitespace&#8221;. And there&#8217;s another fun one called &#8220;Shuffled&#8221; which will randomise the order of any text that is passed as an input.</p>
<p>You can download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1407730596?uo=4">Text Case on the App Store</a>, and you can find out more information on all the functionality in Text Case <a href="https://textcase.app">on the website</a>.</p>
