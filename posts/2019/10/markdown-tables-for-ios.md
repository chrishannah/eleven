title: Markdown Tables for iOS
---

<p>Whenever I want to add a table to a blog post, I always wonder if an app can do it for me.  As I find writing Markdown tables to be rather tedious. The only problem is, I never actually looked. However, I&#8217;ve now been using an aptly named app &#8220;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/markdown-tables/id1476068521">Markdown Tables</a>&#8221; and it&#8217;s just perfect.</p>
<p>It features a really clean interface, that lets you focus solely on the table content. You have all the necessary tools at the top, there&#8217;s one to create a new table with a certain size or from the clipboard, inserting and deleting rows/columns, alignment, whether to include the header row, and the export button! It looks simple, however, it has all the functionality that you&#8217;ll need. It handles large tables quite well, as you can scroll around the content, and then simply tap on the field you want to edit, and it snaps it into place.</p>
<p>Exporting is maybe the most important feature of the app, and it couldn&#8217;t get any easier. All you need to do is tap the export button above the table, and the formatted table will be copied. Markdown Tables actually supports Markdown and HTML exporting, each with their own options for customising the format. Such as compact mode for Markdown, and also whether to pretty print the HTML.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fantastic utility, and I recommend it to anyone writing Markdown on iOS.</p>
