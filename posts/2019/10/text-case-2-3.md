<p>It’s time for <em>another</em> update to Text Case! This time it brings another 5 formats, all relating to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.</p>
<p>There’s support for creating Blockquotes, which supports multiple paragraphs (which I personally wanted a lot), Code Blocks, and also ordered and unordered lists. You can also convert any Markdown to HTML!</p>
<p>All of these formats are, of course, available to use via the app, the Action Extension, and also in the Shortcuts app. And with these new additions, Text Case now has 32 different formats! Including four variants of Title Case.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1407730596?uo=4">Text Case on the App Store</a>.</p>
