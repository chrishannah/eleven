  Tom Hegen

<blockquote><p>
  The photographer tells Colossal that his work centers around the topic of the Anthropocene (the era of human influence on Earth’s biological, geological, and atmospheric processes). “In my photography, I explore the origin and scale of that idea in an effort to understand the dimensions of man’s intervention in natural spaces and to direct attention toward how humans can take responsibility.” Hegen explains that aerial photography in particular helps convey the Anthropocene because it shows the dimensions and scale of human impact more effectively.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s fascinating subject to focus on, and the photography is stunning.</p>
<p>Tom Hegen also created a short video containing some aerial shorts of the greenhouses.</p>
