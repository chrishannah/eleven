title: My Favourite Git Commit
---

<p><a href="https://fatbusinessman.com/2019/my-favourite-git-commit">David Thompson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I like Git commit messages. Used well, I think they’re one of the most powerful tools available to document a codebase over its lifetime. I’d like to illustrate that by showing you my favourite ever Git commit.</p>
<p>This commit is from my time at the Government Digital Service, working on GOV.UK. It’s from a developer by the name of Dan Carley, and it has the rather unassuming name of “Convert template to US-ASCII to fix error”.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a rather funny bug fix, but at the same time there’s a lot of good points you can take from the level of detail that was put in.</p>
