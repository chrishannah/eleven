title: An 81 Megapixel Image of the Moon Makes an Awesome Wallpaper

<blockquote>
<p>The details of this 81 megapixel image of the moon is jaw-dropping — you can see everything.</p>
<p>Best of all, it works incredibly well as an iPhone or iPad wallpaper. The way it lights up the lock screen — especially on the iPhone — is stunning. In effect, it looks like the iPhone progressively lights up the screen, creating a fascinating effect with the lit moon that isn’t replicated the same in other types of images.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s right, it looks incredible.</p>
