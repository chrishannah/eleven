title: They're Features, Not Bugs
---

<p>World of Warcraft Classic now has a release date, and it has also entered into a beta testing phase. Which means some players are now getting the chance to either remember what World of Warcraft was in the early days, or in some cases I imagine they are seeing it for the first time, depending on when they started.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about WoW Classic, I would recommend <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/wowclassic">checking out the website</a>. But the short version, is that after 15 years, WoW has grown to be quite a different game than it once was. The sense of community has gradually disappeared, with more tools being added to the game, that simply add you to a random group to do a certain task, and then you leave. Before it was more organic. Another major difference is the difficulty, WoW was full of challenges, and although everything was a lot slower, you felt like you really earned any reward you got.</p>
<p>Just for the record, I&#8217;m going to play this game like mad.</p>
<p>So, while beta testing has been going on, there are clearly some people that either have clouded memories of the past, or just had completely different expectations. So much so, that Blizzard has had to write a post on the forums titled &#8220;<a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887">WoW Classic “Not A Bug” List</a>&#8220;. To inform beta testers that the bugs they are reporting, are actually art of the game. And most likely were there for some time.</p>
<p>They introduced the post in the most polite way I could think of:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we’ve discussed before, the nature of WoW Classic sometimes invokes different memories for different players, and this leads to certain misconceptions for some about what is or isn’t working as intended.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find it funny thinking about all of the reported bugs, and how many of these are actually features that people have forgotten about. It appears some people are going to have a bad time when they first play WoW Classic.</p>
