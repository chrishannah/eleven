title: My Short List of iOS 13 Wishes
---

<p>I was going to try and write a big long post about my wishes for iOS 13, but my list sadly never passed 6 items. So seeing as WWDC is just around the corner, I’ll publish what I’ve got.</p>
<h2>Dark Mode</h2>
<p>I’ve wanted this for quite some time, and it looks like we’re going to be getting it. So I think this is a near-guaranteed part of iOS 13.</p>
<h2>Shortcuts API</h2>
<p>I want apps to have a much deeper integration with Shortcuts. Mainly the ability to add native actions into the Shortcuts app. But also parameter support, so apps like my Text Case won’t need to interact solely with the clipboard.</p>
<h2>Home Screen Widgets</h2>
<p>We’ve been waiting for a refresh of the home screen for a while, and I think the ability to add “widgets” would be a good fit.</p>
<h2>Picture-in-Picture on iPhone</h2>
<p>This is a feature that I don’t hold much hope of being implemented. However, there are scenarios where I want to watch a video while quickly doing something else on my iPhone. So Picture-in-Picture would<br />
Be very handy. Although sporadically used.</p>
<h2>More Widgets on the iPad</h2>
<p>I’m not sure why this ever changed. But on the iPad you used to be able to see two columns of widgets, and now it’s restricted to just one. I want the whole screen to be filled with them!</p>
<h2>Do Not Disturb while Using a Device</h2>
<p>One last annoyance that has turned into a feature request, a Do Not Disturb setting that still applies when you’re using the device. If I’m watching a video with my girlfriend during dinner, I really don’t need to see notifications. Especially as it usually pushes what we’re watching momentarily.</p>
