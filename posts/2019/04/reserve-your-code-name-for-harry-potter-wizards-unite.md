title: 'Reserve Your Code Name for Harry Potter: Wizards Unite!'
---

<p>Niantic Labs, the developers behind Ingress, Pokémon GO, and the upcoming Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, are offering users the chance to reserve their “Code Names” on the Harry Potter game.</p>
<p>You can’t just reserve any name at random. But if you have an Ingress or Pokémon GO account, you can reserve the name you used for those games. However, as there are two games that can be used to reserve a name, and one name may be “owned” by different people on each game, it’s not guaranteed that your name will be available. They will be operating on a first come, first served basis.</p>
<p>Another reason to hurry is that it’s only available until the end of April!</p>
<p>Once the game is released, you’ll have six months to use the name until it expires. To retrieve your name when log in to Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, you must use the same method, whether it was email/password, Google, Facebook, etc.</p>
<p>If you are a Pokémon GO or Ingress player, you should have an email telling you about this. But just to make it easier, you can <a href="http://nianticlabs.com/hpwu-codenamereservation">go straight to the Name Reservation page</a>.</p>
