title: Growing a Jungle in My New York Apartment
---

<p>Ever since moving in to a new home with my girlfriend, I’ve been thinking of ways to add a bit more nature. We both like the look of plants, and having quite a lot of green in the house, but she would prefer fake ones, and I would prefer all real plants.</p>
<p>As I was watching videos about what other people have inside their house, I discovered a woman called Summer Rayne Oakes (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/homesteadbrooklyn/">@homesteadbrooklyn on Instagram</a>). A channel called Barcroft TV have a great video of her apartment in New York, and shows how she fits in over 150 different plant species.</p>
<p>It’s absolutely incredible.</p>

<p>While I wouldn’t mind living in this apartment, I’m pretty sure whatever I go with, won’t be as crazy.</p>
