title: My Experience Using Castro as My Primary Podcast App
---

<p>For quite a few years now, I&#8217;ve been using <a href="https://overcast.fm/podcasts">Overcast</a> as my podcast app of choice. It&#8217;s a great app, and it&#8217;s praised by basically anyone that uses it. However, I had never really used an alternative. So I wasn&#8217;t sure if I really was using the best app that was on offer.</p>
<p>After doing a bit of research, and hearing about it in the past, I decided on <a href="http://supertop.co/castro/">Castro</a>. It&#8217;s the app that I&#8217;ve seen the most talked about online, second to only Overcast.</p>

<p>As I mentioned on my journal entries on <a href="https://chrishannah.me/journal-8-apr-2019/">April 8th</a> and <a href="https://chrishannah.me/journal-9-apr-2019/">9th</a>, one of the best features of Castro, in my opinion, is the focus that&#8217;s put into queuing episodes. And in particular, the idea of triaging new episodes, so that you can have a more refined queue. This helped me a lot, as I was getting to a place where I had so many episodes build up in my list, that I didn&#8217;t know what to listen to next. And in some cases, there were episodes that I knew that I would never get around to listen to, but I just didn&#8217;t want to remove them.</p>
<p>Starting with an import of my subscription from Overcast via the export/import OPML files in both apps, the Inbox in Castro was filled up with the most recent episodes of all my subscriptions. From there I started assigning each episode to either the top/bottom of the queue, or removing it from the list. This resulted in a pretty small queue, I think it was around 6 episodes, and my list would usually be around 20 in Overcast.</p>
<p>As new episodes continually appeared in the Inbox, I found it rather easy to sort through them, and pick out the episodes I wanted to listen to. It seems strange, but this feature alone made me listen to many more podcasts. It removed some of the unnecessary choice, so I could always find something I wanted to listen to. Because of the queuing, and the fact that you prioritise episodes in the queue when triaging the Inbox, it&#8217;s always ready whenever you just want to jump in a quickly listen to something. Or maybe in the morning, when you haven&#8217;t quite woken up yet, but you still want something for the commute.</p>

<p>I did think I would miss the two great enhancements that Overcast offers, Voice Boost and Smart Speed. However, Castro have their own versions, Enhance Voices and Trim Silence. I didn&#8217;t notice any difference in this regard. So either, they both work with a similar level of quality, or I just don&#8217;t notice the feature on either apps. Either way, it&#8217;s not an issue for me.</p>
<p>One thing I did notice about playback though, was when resuming an episode, I really missed Overcast&#8217;s &#8220;Smart Resume&#8221;. It&#8217;s really handy when you pause in the middle of a word, because Overcast will rewind slightly to the gap before the word. It sounds like a minuscule feature, but you soon get used to it.</p>

<p>Something else that caused me a bit of friction when I first started using Castro, was the way you found the show notes of an episode. In Castro, you swipe left → right and &#8220;activate&#8221; the Info button, which launches the show notes above the current context. However, I was really used to the interface in Overcast, where you swiped right → left to view the show notes, and then once more to view the chapters (if the episode had them). These are nothing major, and are mostly caused by muscle memory.</p>
<p>After using Castro as my podcast app for a while, I was in a situation where I wanted to listen to a podcast on my iPad. And that is when I discovered the lack of Castro! So after all the benefits I found with the queuing feature, the nice refreshing interface, and also a few pain-points, I literally couldn&#8217;t use the app anymore. I kept using the Castro app on my phone for a few days, but I had to stop, because managing two podcast apps would be crazy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to state that I really like Castro. And while there are a few things that I was used to in Overcast, that caused friction when using Castro, the overall experience was great. I just can&#8217;t use an app on iOS that isn&#8217;t universal anymore. I&#8217;ve gone back to Overcast for now, and I&#8217;m going to try and take small things I&#8217;ve learned from triaging episodes in Castro, so I can better handle my podcast list. But I&#8217;m always going to be hoping for the day when Castro comes to the iPad.</p>
