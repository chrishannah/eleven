title: The Escape Key on iPad

This is just a quick little tip for iPad users out there. If you are like me and using the Smart Keyboard or any keyboard that doesn&#8217;t have an Escape key you can press command . and that will most likely work as a way to escape from any text input you are in.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think I’ve heard of this vaguely in the past. But after seeing this post, I tried it in a few different places in iOS, and I can confirm that it’s probably the closest escape key alternative.</p>
<p>The escape key on a Mac does all kind of things. Such as cancelling a drag action, cancelling some kind of input, or closing a temporary window. This <em>“escape key”</em> is more limited, in that I’ve only see it escape from text entry. That doesn’t mean it’s not handy though, and I’m sure I’ll use this quite a bit.</p>
