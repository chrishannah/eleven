<p>Thrasher Magazine have came out with <a href="https://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/videos/high-and-dry-video/">a 10 minute video</a> of some of the best skateboarders skating around a water park.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Keys to a drained water park and free rein to skate everything in sight?! Yes please! There are a lot of Epic Spots out there but this is truly Insane Terrain. And apparently upside-down ollies are a thing now&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>It features skateboarders like Tony Hawk, Daewon Song, Aaron “Jaws” Homoki, and so many more! They truly make use of the use slides.</p>

<p>They also <a href="https://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/high-n-dry-article/">shared an article</a>, where they go through the story of how they happened to actually be allowed to do this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What started as some light trespassing turned into a week-long permission session. The powers that be rolled out the red carpet for a week of slams, jams and NBDs. Some of the gnarliest transition skaters of our time ventured out to the desert to try their luck at the Pacific Sun—a 300-foot funnel complete with a mini-mega roll in. The park is being renovated and the Sun will soon be torn out, so this was a for real Holy Grail quest with the timer ticking. No excuses—get some!
</p></blockquote>
<p>And it also contains some pretty cool photos</p>
