title: The International Fixed Calendar
---

<p>I came across the idea of having a fixed, 13-month calendar, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignPorn/comments/cowwk2/let_us_make_this_international_fixed_calendar_work/">on Reddit</a>, and it immediately sparked my interest. Each month would have four weeks, and every month would start on a Monday.</p>
<p>Someone then shared a link to the Wikipedia page of something called the &#8220;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar">International Fixed Calendar</a>&#8220;. Either this is where the Redditor got the idea from, or it&#8217;s just a coincidence. Anyway, it sounds good to me!</p>
<p>It means that every single day of the year will <em>always</em> be the same day of the week. Which, in my opinion, makes so much sense.</p>
<p>So every month would look like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Sunday</strong></th>
<th><strong>Monday</strong></th>
<th><strong>Tuesday</strong></th>
<th><strong>Wednesday</strong></th>
<th><strong>Thursday</strong></th>
<th><strong>Friday</strong></th>
<th><strong>Saturday</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>13</td>
<td>14</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>15</td>
<td>16</td>
<td>17</td>
<td>18</td>
<td>19</td>
<td>20</td>
<td>21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>22</td>
<td>23</td>
<td>24</td>
<td>25</td>
<td>26</td>
<td>27</td>
<td>28</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Thirteenth Month</h2>
<p>The proposed name for the thirteenth month would be &#8220;Sol&#8221;, and it would be placed between June and July. The name Sol represents the Sun, as it falls on the mid-year solstice.</p>
<h2>Recalculation</h2>
<p>This would, of course, require all current dates to be recalculated. So your birthday would change, and other events like Easter, that change every year.</p>
<h2>Leap Years</h2>
<p>You may be thinking &#8220;this sounds good, but what about leap years?&#8221;. You&#8217;ll be pleased to know that the idea of a &#8220;Leap Day&#8221;, it occurs on the 29th of June. However, it is not classed as being part of any week, and is situated between the Saturday June 28 and Sunday Sol 1.</p>
<h2>New Years Day</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar situation for New Years Day. But as you may already know, this happens every year. New Years Day would be another &#8220;bonus&#8221; day on the 29th of December. It too is between the last Saturday of the year, and the first Sunday of the proceeding year.</p>
<h2>Why Aren&#8217;t We Using It?</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s three main reasons why were aren&#8217;t using this calendar right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn&#8217;t easily support quarters. Right now we have three months in a quarter, but in this calendar, it would be three months and one week.</li>
<li>Some religions oppose it, as traditions like worshiping on every seventh day, would mess up on a Leap Day or New Years Day.</li>
<li>We just aren&#8217;t used to it. And therefore a lot of dates would have to be changed, and the systems we have in place would need to adapt.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Converter</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s no converter online that I can find right now, so hopefully I can find one soon, or maybe I&#8217;ll have to make one and upload it myself.</p>
