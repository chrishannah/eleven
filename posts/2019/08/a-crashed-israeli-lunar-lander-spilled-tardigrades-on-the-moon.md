title: A Crashed Israeli Lunar Lander Spilled Tardigrades on the Moon

<p>Daniel Oberhaus, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-crashed-israeli-lunar-lander-spilled-tardigrades-on-the-moon/">writing for Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It was just before midnight on April 11 and everyone at the Israel Aerospace Industries mission control center in Yehud, Israel, had their eyes fixed on two large projector screens. On the left screen was a stream of data being sent back to Earth by Beresheet, its lunar lander, which was about to become the first private spacecraft to land on the moon. The right screen featured a crude animation of Beresheet firing its engines as it prepared for a soft landing in the Sea of Serenity. But only seconds before the scheduled landing, the numbers on the left screen stopped. Mission control had lost contact with the spacecraft, and it crashed into the moon shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>  Half a world away, Nova Spivack watched a livestream of Beresheet’s mission control from a conference room in Los Angeles. As the founder of the Arch Mission Foundation, a nonprofit whose goal is to create “a backup of planet Earth,” Spivack had a lot at stake in the Beresheet mission. The spacecraft was carrying the foundation’s first lunar library, a DVD-sized archive containing 30 million pages of information, human DNA samples, and thousands of tardigrades, those microscopic “water bears” that can survive pretty much any environment—including space.</p>
<p>  But when the Israelis confirmed Beresheet had been destroyed, Spivack was faced with a distressing question: Did he just smear the toughest animal in the known universe across the surface of the moon?

<p>This is a very interesting story. It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve heard of the Arch Mission Foundation, and I find it fascinating that people are trying to spread information regarding the human race around the solar system.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting is the fact that they also sent tardigrades. I&#8217;ve heard about them before, and how they can survive basically anywhere. So, although they were sent in a dehydrated state, it&#8217;s weird to think that there is actually now life on the Moon. It might not be the first time, but it&#8217;s the first I&#8217;ve heard of such scenario.</p>
