title: Focussing on the Wrong Things When Starting a Blog
---

<p>Whenever I read about blogging, whether it&#8217;s people asking how to get started, tips on how to be better, or just anything in general about writing online, I tend to disagree quite a lot on the feedback that is shared.</p>
<p>I think that, especially when you are starting to write a blog, nearly everything that I see being suggested is detrimental.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s telling you to start worrying about SEO, prioritise getting your website linked to from popular websites, working out monetisation, creating a schedule, creating the perfect design, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>If you are trying to start a blog, then the best advice is to <em>just start writing</em>, and then press publish. Sure, it might not be the best content you&#8217;ll ever produce, but it&#8217;s <em>something</em>. Then with the experience of writing and publishing that post, the next one will be slightly better.</p>
<p>Maybe no-one will ever see your first blog post, but that&#8217;s not exactly important. The most important thing is that you wrote it. And with it being made available for the world to read, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll immediately find something you could have done better. So you learn from these mistakes and fix them in the next. These aren&#8217;t necessarily mistakes, just a representation of experience, which of course, comes with time.</p>
<p>Just like experience, in time your audience will grow, and if they like your content, they&#8217;ll come back. And maybe they&#8217;ll even think about sharing it with other people. But the content needs to be there before they can do that, and it needs to provide them with some level of value. But even that isn&#8217;t majorly important when you start.</p>
<p>Your aim should be to produce the best content you can. And if people value that content, then even better. If your aim is to make the most money possible or to get high numbers on your analytics, then in my opinion, you&#8217;re focussing on the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m too much a fantasist in that I think every blogger should at least be attempting to produce great content. But isn&#8217;t that the most logical target? If not, then I think you&#8217;re blogging for the wrong reason.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve built up a body of work, and still regularly providing content, then it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to try and get that content to more people. But it&#8217;s not the most important thing. And I would argue that it&#8217;s especially not important for people that just want to start blogging.</p>
<p>All I&#8217;m saying is, if you want to start blogging, then the only thing that matters is getting words out of your head, and published somewhere. You don&#8217;t need to worry about the overall theme of your content, your writing style, the name of your blog, getting the perfect domain name, figuring out what tools you want to use, you&#8217;ll figure that out once you&#8217;ve actually started.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that you actually start.</p>

<p>If after all of this you don&#8217;t agree with me, that&#8217;s fine. Simply write it all down and publish it to your blog. Then write some more, and some more, and maybe send me a link.</p>
