title: Beyond Spectre 1.0
---

<p>Ben Sandofsky, the developer of the popular app Halide, and now Spectre, <a href="https://blog.halide.cam/beyond-spectre-1-0-43b77806c76c">shared an update on how the Spectre launch went, and also their plan for future releases</a>:</p>
<p>He also shared some photos taken on Spectre, which look amazing. The hashtag they&#8217;re using is <code>#SpectreShot</code>, so I may have to share some myself.</p>
<p>The section I found most interesting was about the initial release:</p>
<blockquote><p>To say our launch was a success would be an understatement. On day 1, Spectre instantly rose to the first place in the App Store. We had features on The Verge, The Daily Mail, Lonely Planet, Macstories, CNet, Macrumors, 9to5Mac, Uncrate and more.</p>
<p>It was a bit too much success: We rose up the charts so fast that one of Apple’s fraud detection systems kicked in. For a half a day, we were missing from the charts. Yikes! We were panicking and got in touch with Apple.</p>
<p>Fortunately, after Apple’s fine people verified we weren’t gaming the system, we were back at #1, where we stuck it out for almost a whole week.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had never heard about these &#8220;fraud detection systems&#8221;, but the people at iA (iA Writer Developers) <a href="https://ia.net/writer/blog/what-happens-to-the-traffic-you-send-to-the-app-store">wrote about it last year</a>. It&#8217;s a huge piece of writing, and there&#8217;s a ton of great investigation as well, but essentially they found that an increase in traffic to the App Store, can negatively affect the apps ranking. That sounds pretty weird to me.</p>
<p>Fortunately/Unfortunately for me, none of my apps have managed to be affected by the fraud detection systems.</p>
