title: Using the Action Extension in Text Case To Format Text
---

<p>This is a guide related to my app, Text Case. It’s a utility app that lets you transform text into various different formats. You can <a href="https://chrishannah.me/category/text-case-guides/">find all the guides in one place</a>, and Text Case <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1407730596?mt=8">on the App Store</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Although the main Text Case app can be a very useful app to have open while you’re formatting a few pieces of text, sometimes you just want a little less friction while you’re writing.</p>
<p>That’s why you can format any text in iOS, simply by selecting text, sharing it to Text Case, and then just tapping once on the format you want to use. It’s a flow I use whenever I’m writing on my iPhone or my iPad, because it allows you to completely focus on your writing, without needing to manually switch apps to just format a title.</p>
<h2>Enabling the Extension</h2>
<p>First off, you’ll need to enable the Action Extension. This can be quite long-winded, so it’s best to follow along with the screenshots below, or there are some written steps.</p>

</p>
<ol>
<li>Select any text in your favourite text editor.</li>
<li>Tap Share.</li>
<li>When the share sheet appears, on the bottom row you’ll find an option called “More” with three dots as the icon. Tap that.</li>
<li>It should then open a list where you can enable and disable any available actions from your installed apps. You need to enable Text Case’s “Convert Text” action.</li>
<li>After that, tap done, and it will appear in the list of actions in the bottom row of the share sheet.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Formatting Text via the Extension</h2>
<p>Once you’ve got it enabled, formatting text is rather simple.</p>

</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the text you want to format.</li>
<li>Tap Share.</li>
<li>Select “Convert Text” from the bottom row of the share sheet.</li>
<li>When Text Case appears, you just need to tap once on the format you want to use. By default Title Case will be the first option.</li>
<li>After you tapped on the formatted title in Text Case, you will be returned to your previous app, where your text should still be selected.</li>
<li>You can now tap on Paste to overwrite the text with the formatted version.</li>
</ol>
