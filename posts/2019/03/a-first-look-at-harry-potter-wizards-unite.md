<p>So, there&#8217;s been a ton of new information shared about the upcoming Harry Potter AR game, Wizards Unite. And it&#8217;s certainly shaping up to be an incredible game!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the back story:</p>
<blockquote><p>A calamity has befallen the wizarding world, causing artefacts, creatures, people, and even memories to mysteriously appear in the Muggle world. Witches and wizards from across the globe must come together to solve the mystery of The Calamity, overcome the confounding chaotic magic that surrounds these “Foundables,” and return them to their rightful place, keeping them safe from Muggle eyes.</p>
<p>Your journey begins as a new recruit of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, established by the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards for the purpose of investigating and containing The Calamity.</p></blockquote>
<p>From the story alone, there&#8217;s a massive scope for what the game could turn out to be. On one side of the scale, it could have been a simple rip-off of Pokémon GO, but essentially a hide-and-seek game with a Harry Potter theme. But instead, what we&#8217;re getting is a much more all-rounded role-playing game!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1294" height="1349" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6958" src="https://chrishannah.me/images/2019/03/Image.png" alt="Image" srcset="https://chrishannah.me/images/2019/03/Image.png 1294w, https://chrishannah.me/images/2019/03/Image-288x300.png 288w, https://chrishannah.me/images/2019/03/Image-768x801.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1294px) 100vw, 1294px" /></p>
<p>Of course, at it&#8217;s an AR game, one of the key mechanics will be exploring the world, finding some of the &#8220;Foundables&#8221;, casting spells, and also Portkeys that offer a full 360 AR experience out in the real wold. That already feels to me a more immersive experience than Pokémon GO (And I&#8217;m a big Pokémon GO player!).</p>
<p>Where I think the richness of the game will come from, is the things like potion making, challenging other wizards and foes in Wizarding Challenges, and developing your Wizarding skills while specialising in certain professions.</p>
<p>It sounds like a game with many ways to play. You can simply explore the world, while finding &#8220;Foundables&#8221;, Portkeys, potion ingredients, etc. You can compete with other players by battling with them at Fortresses, but you can also team up with them and compete Wizard Challenges together. And at the same time as all of that, you&#8217;re developing your own character, gaining new skills, and just taking your own route through the game.</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;m unsure about though, is the &#8220;Spell Energy&#8221;. I&#8217;ve never found a mobile game that has some kind of perishable energy source to be that great. As there&#8217;s usually long waits to refill, mostly with the aim for players to spend money on in-app purchases. You can find food and drinks at &#8220;Inns&#8221;, which will be in certain places around the world, and will replenish your Spell Energy. Hopefully there&#8217;s enough of them so it doesn&#8217;t inhibit gameplay.</p>
<p>My other worry is that the game will be too rich. Sure, I wrote earlier that it&#8217;s one of the reasons why I like the sound of this game, but maybe other people won&#8217;t appreciate it. As not everyone is as well versed in the Harry Potter universe as others (me), and a steep learning curve for a mobile game may not work out well.</p>
<p>But despite how anyone else finds it, I can already tell I&#8217;m going to be really addicted to this game.</p>
