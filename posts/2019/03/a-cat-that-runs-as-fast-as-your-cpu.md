title: A Cat That Runs as Fast as Your CPU
---

<p>There are loads of apps that track your Macs CPU usage. But only one of them uses a running cat to visualise it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.chrishannah.me/images/2019/03/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6923" alt="ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif" width="556" height="228"></p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/runcat/id1429033973?mt=12">RunCat</a> is a free Mac menu bar app that features a running cat that adapts to your CPU speed. If it&#8217;s running relatively slow, then the cat will just be running at a leisurely pace, but if it&#8217;s running really high (try building a huge Xcode project), then the cat will go crazy!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really fun!</p>
<h2>Runners</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not just a cat either, you get to choose from 21 different &#8220;runners&#8221; for free &#8211; Cat α, Cat β, Cat γ, Cat Tail, Mock Nyan Cat, Parrot, Human, Push-Up, Sit-Up, Rubber Duck, City, Sausage, Dots, Dinosaur, Terrier, Hedgehog, Horse, Penguin 2, Hamster Wheel, Octopus, and Steam Train.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also another 21 runners if you want to pay for them &#8211; Cheetah, Dog, Puppy, Rabbit, Frog, Bird, Penguin, Dolphin, Dragon, Owl, Cogwheel, Bonfire, Drop, Rocket, Pendulum, Newtons Cradle, Sine Curve, Pulse, Coffee, Reindeer &amp; Sleigh, and Snowman.</p>
<p>And if you really want to personalise RunCat, there&#8217;s a paid option to unlock the &#8220;Self-Made Runner&#8221;, which will let you create your own animation to track your CPU usage.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<p>There are a few options in RunCat to change the way it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show CPU Usage &#8211; This puts the CPU usage percentage as text next to the runner.</li>
<li>Invert Speed &#8211; This means the runner will be running fast when your CPU speed is low, and vice versa. Sounds weird to me.</li>
<li>Flipped Horizontally &#8211; This flips your runner, so it will run in the opposite direction.</li>
<li>Launch at Login &#8211; I shouldn&#8217;t need to explain this.</li>
</ul>
