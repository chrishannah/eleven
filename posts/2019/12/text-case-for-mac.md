title: Text Case for Mac
---

<p>I&#8217;ve been slowly working on this for quite a few months now, but I think it&#8217;s finally time to release <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1492174677?ls=1&amp;mt=12">Text Case for Mac</a>.</p>
<p>With it comes all 32 formats that are currently supported in the iOS app, and the same customisation options (except custom app icons).</p>
<p>To recap all of those:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title Case (AP, APA, CMOS, MLA)</li>
<li>URL Encoded/Decoded</li>
<li>Uppercase</li>
<li>Lowercase</li>
<li>Capitalise</li>
<li>Capitalise Words</li>
<li>Sentence Case</li>
<li>Reversed</li>
<li>Strip HTML</li>
<li>Strip/Trim Whitespace</li>
<li>Markdown Blockquote</li>
<li>Markdown Code Block</li>
<li>Markdown Ordered/Unordered List</li>
<li>Markdown to HTML</li>
<li>Camel Case</li>
<li>Snake Case</li>
<li>Pascal Case</li>
<li>Kebab Case</li>
<li>Hashtags</li>
<li>Mocking Spongebob</li>
<li>Emoji</li>
<li>Base64 Encoded/Decoded</li>
<li>Rot13</li>
<li>Clap Case</li>
<li>Shuffled</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact the macOS version is 2.4.4, and the iOS version is sitting at just 2.4.3. The only differences being some improvements to the Emoji format, where some localisations could cause the format to not work at all (it now defaults to English if it doesn&#8217;t support the language). And also some macOS specific changes, which are mainly to remove parts of the app that won&#8217;t work such as Siri Shortcuts support, and also fine tuning the macOS experience.</p>
<p>There are things that I&#8217;m already planning on adding the Mac version, such as an Extension so you can format text from outside the app, similar to how the Action Extension works in IOS, and also other automation support such as URL schemes. However, I feel that it&#8217;s much more beneficial for people to have Text Case for Mac now, rather than waiting even longer to get it into peoples hands. Because just like the iOS app, I really like to adapt the app to users feedback, and I already have a few extra formats (such as small caps) that I plan on adding soon. I also want to see what I can do with the Touch Bar!</p>
<p>Have a look at the Mac version:</p>
