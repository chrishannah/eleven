title: Bring Back the iPod Click Wheel With Rewound
---

<p>I came across a fun app recently on Twitter, called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rewound-music-player/id1481219461">Rewound</a>. It&#8217;s a Music app that simply acts as an interface to your music library, but it comes with a rather interesting quirk, it looks like an old iPod. And you can even go back to a click wheel.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrishannah.me/images/2019/12/Rewound-App.png" alt="Rewound App" title="Rewound App.PNG" border="0" width="1630" height="1400">.</p>
<p>The control layout can be changed within the app, however to apply a matching skin you have to download them from Twitter/Weibo (You can find them with the <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=rewoundskins">#rewoundskins hashtag</a>) or add custom photos from your device.</p>
<p>Depending on the skin you add, it automatically assigns a layout based on the size. And if you use one with a click wheel, you will actually be able to use the circular gestures to navigate through your music collection.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit of fun, and I&#8217;m sure some nostalgic people will love to see it. I can&#8217;t quite say I see this as a long term product though!</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rewound-music-player/id1481219461">Download Rewound for free on the App Store</a></p>
<hr />
<p><em>Update: 18th December 2019</em></p>
<p>It turns out that Apple have now rejected Rewound, and it&#8217;s no longer available to download. (<a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/12/18/rewound-rejected-from-the-app-store/">via Michael Tsai</a>)</p>
