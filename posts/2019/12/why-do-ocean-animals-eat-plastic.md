title: Why Do Ocean Animals Eat Plastic?
---

<p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/12/whales-eating-plastic-pollution/">Natasha Daly, writing for National Geographic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Why would an apex ocean predator eat gloves? Or rope? Or plastic cups? How does a whale end up with more than 200 pounds of waste in its stomach?</p>
<p>  Last week, a ten-year-old whale was found dead on a beach in Scotland. A necropsy revealed 220 pounds of plastic and other trash congealed in clumps in his digestive system. The tragedy grabbed headlinesâ€”the sheer quantity of debris eclipsed that found in a growing number of similar cases: large whales discovered dead on beaches around the world with stomachs full of garbage.

<p>I thought this would end up being quite a simple answer, but it turns out animals eat plastic for a whole host of reasons.</p>
