title: The Berlin Wall Obscured With Embroidery
---

<p>Diane Meyer has come up with an incredible series, where she has taken photos around the previously split city, and used hand embroidery to obscure different sections.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dianemeyer.net/berlin/berlin.html">Diane Meyer:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The embroidery is made to resemble pixels and borrows the visual language of digital imaging in an analog, handmade process. The images were taken in the city center as well as in the suburbs where I followed the former path of the wall through the outskirts of the city. I was interested in the psychological weight of these sites and the ways in which past history remains very much in the present. In many images, the embroidered sections represent the exact scale and location of the former Wall offering a pixelated view of what lies behind. In this way, the embroidery appears as a translucent trace in the landscape of something that no longer exists but is a weight on history and memory.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are 21 photographs in total, and my favourite three would have to be these:</p>
