title: The New 16-Inch MacBook Pro
---

<p>Apple today, took me by surprise and announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/">a new MacBook Pro</a>. A 16-inch one to be exact.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very excited about this machine, for various different reasons which I will discuss below. But it has come at a very good point at least from my perspective, as I&#8217;ve been recently feeling the need to upgrade my current Mac because of the annoyances I have with it.</p>
<h2>My Current Machine</h2>
<p>To provide some context, my current machine is the MacBook Pro 13-inch Late 2016 model (<a href="https://twitter.com/chrishannah/status/1194633619035152384">not Early-2015 that I somehow thought I had earlier</a>). It has a 6th generation 3.1 GHz Dual-Core i5 CPU, a whopping 256 GB SSD, and 8 GB of memory.</p>
<p>I purchased this while I was at university, so my budget was limited. And that is clearly represented in the specs of the machine. I clearly did not think about the lack of upgradability when I purchased it.</p>
<p>It was a good machine when I first bought it, but over the years it feels like it&#8217;s causing friction whenever I want to get something done. Which is a big reason why I think I&#8217;m going to buy this new model.</p>
<h2>What I Do on My Mac</h2>
<p>Along with the usual web browsing, Twitter scrolling, and other common tasks, there are only a few main tasks that I use my Mac for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing applications</li>
<li>Writing</li>
<li>Gaming</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are perfectly capable tasks for my machine, but I would say that each of them certainly comes with its own level of friction.</p>
<p>For example, I find developing iOS apps to be cumbersome on a 13-inch screen. This used to be fine for me, but I&#8217;ve since been using external displays at work, and I find the 13-inch to be just a <em>bit</em> too compact. The time it takes to compile my projects, and run simulators to be annoying. Not necessarily what I would call slow, but it&#8217;s certainly not enjoyable. And with the limited time I have to develop my own personal projects, I want my machine to be as accessible as possible.</p>
<p>The writing I do is essentially all for this blog. I use whatever text editor that tickles my fancy at a moment in time, and I write in plain Markdown. It&#8217;s nothing that demands much resources from the machine at all. But it does require a reliable keyboard, and while the current keyboard served me well at the beginning (I personally don&#8217;t mind the &#8220;clacky&#8221; noise it produces), I&#8217;ve been slowly finding problems with it. My command keys are a bit flaky, I still haven&#8217;t adjusted to the escape key being in the Touch Bar, I occasionally get double characters when typing, and it generally just doesn&#8217;t feel as comfortable as other keyboards have been for me.</p>
<p>To me, a keyboard is something that you shouldn&#8217;t really notice, but when using this machine to type anything (<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1230385">I don&#8217;t need Grammarly</a>), I&#8217;m constantly aware of it. Even if it&#8217;s not making any errors, I know it <em>can</em> and it means I can&#8217;t always focus properly on my writing.</p>
<p>By gaming, I&#8217;d like to refine this to playing World of Warcraft. It&#8217;s the only game I play on my Mac, and I certainly do play it quite a lot. You may be surprised by the fact that I actually game on a Mac, but while this machine isn&#8217;t necessarily built for it (It only has integrated graphics and 8 GB of memory), it gets the job done. But I&#8217;ve always wanted a better machine for this reason alone. World of Warcraft can look amazing on a Mac, I&#8217;ve just never purchased one good enough.</p>
<h2>What Can the 16-Inch MacBook Pro Offer Me?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious improvement that this machine has over my current machine is the size of the screen. I really want a bigger screen, and now it&#8217;s an inch bigger than I thought I&#8217;d go. I used to be hesitant about this for many reasons, but because of my iPad Pro that I use quite a lot, I&#8217;m not taking this on as many trips as I used to. So essentially the only portability I need is the ability to move it around my house.</p>
<p>The keyboard is the most major difference that I think is a real problem solver. I have issues with my keyboard, and I would like to hope that with the new key spacing, increased key travel, and the early opinions of reviews, that this will fix my problems. It also features a hardware escape key, which I think is the perfect comprise between having the Touch Bar or not. I like the Touch Bar, but tapping a screen with no tactile feedback for the escape key has always been weird to me.</p>
<p>One improvement that I think shocked everyone with this new model is the new speaker and microphone systems. I don&#8217;t really use the microphone at all, but I watch a lot of videos and listen to a lot of music on my Mac, so these are all welcome changes.</p>
<p>Obviously, with this being a brand new model, using new hardware, it&#8217;s going to bring with it enhancements all over the board. I&#8217;m sure compile times will be faster in Xcode, gaming will be smoother and with much superior graphics, and everyday tasks will surely feel much more seamless.</p>
<h2>What I&#8217;m Looking At</h2>
<p>The spec I&#8217;m looking at getting is the base 2.6GHz 6-Core i7 model, but with an upgraded 32 GB of memory, 1 TB SSD, and the AMD Radeon Pro 5300M with 4GB of memory. I think that GPU would be suitable for my needs, but seeing as the next step is just Â£90, I&#8217;ll have to do some research and see if it&#8217;s worth the jump.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m doing differently now, is that I&#8217;m actually thinking about the future of this Mac. For example, I limited myself to 8 GB of memory last time, and while I think 16 GB is probably fine for me now. I think the extra jump to 32 is going to prove worthwhile in the long run. The same applies to the SSD. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to get anywhere near 500 GB, let alone 1 TB. But it removes a needless restriction, to a machine that simply can&#8217;t be upgraded at a later date.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this new 16-inch MacBook Pro can become a laptop that I actually like using again. And after writing this post, I&#8217;m even more sure that I&#8217;m going to get one.</p>
