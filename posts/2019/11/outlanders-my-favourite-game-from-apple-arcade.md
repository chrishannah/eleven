title: Outlanders - My Favourite Game from Apple Arcade
---

<p>If there’s one game that I’ve been enjoying as part of Apple Arcade, it’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/outlanders/id1463407936">Outlanders</a>. I have been mildly obsessed with it ever since I gave it a try, very soon after it was available.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrishannah.me/images/2019/11/IMG_0065.png" alt="Outlanders Map"></p>
<p>In essence, Outlanders is a game where you control a town of people, have them build out the town, whether it’s a farm to create a sustainable food source, or a tavern which they can go to at night that increases their happiness.</p>
<p>It’s very fun, and it’s based around scenarios that have a primary and secondary goal that you aim towards. For example, the level I’m on right now (6, which is currently the last) has an overall target to build 7 Windmills (which are used to convert wheat to flour, in order for a Bakery to make food), and 5 Taverns. All within 120 days. The optional secondary goal is to have a population of at least 70 by the type you finish.</p>

<p>At the start it’s relatively simple. You have some people forage for foot, while others focus on getting wood, and building houses for a growing population. But eventually you have a big population, that requires a lot of focus on what needs to be prioritised next. The maps are also finite, so the amount of resources (wood and food) will eventually dwindle down, leading you to build farms, windmills, and bakery’s to sustain the food for the population.</p>
<p>The first five levels I managed all within a few attempts, however this last one is proving to be quite difficult. Which is actually one reason why I’m enjoying it. It’s a fun game, which requires attention, and a general plan on how you are going to build out the town and population.</p>
<p>I really hope that the developer adds in more levels soon, as it’s only a matter of time before I’m finished with this one.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/outlanders/id1463407936">download Outlanders as part of Apple Arcade</a>, and I would recommend it as not only one of the best games from the subscription, but of the many games that I’ve played on iOS over the years.</p>
