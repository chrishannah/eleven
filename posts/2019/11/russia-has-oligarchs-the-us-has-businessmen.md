title: Russia Has ‘Oligarchs,’ the US Has ‘Businessmen’

<p><a href="https://fair.org/home/russia-has-oligarchs-the-us-has-businessmen/">Alan Macleod, writing for Fair.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  While not labeling its own wealthy and powerful elites as “oligarchs,” US corporate media do, as noted, occasionally acknowledge that the United States itself is an oligarchy. But even those admissions are few and far between, appearing for the most part only in articles devoted to arguing exactly that point. Otherwise, the US is overwhelmingly presented as a democracy and a force for good in reporting.</p>
<p>  And when a politician like Bernie Sanders suggests that these oligarchs influence the media, senior editors react angrily, claiming he is “ridiculous” and a “conspiracy theorist.” What a strange country the US is—an oligarchy without any oligarchs.
