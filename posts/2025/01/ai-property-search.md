This probably isn't revolutionary, but I've been thinking about this for a
while, and I think I have a **perfect** use case for AI. And that is property
searching.

I heard Rory Sutherland[^1] talk about property searching a while ago,
  and he was explaining how the tools used to search for properties, and the
  housing market in general, isn't fit for purpose. Primarily because your search
  is built around what your perfect house is, e.g. you can look for houses in a
  good catchment area for schools. But he proposes that a better way of seearching
  for a house is to work out what can you live with, that other people would hate.
  His example was living near a railway line, he would enjoy this, most people
  would hate it.

  This example alone got me thinking about AI. And especially tools like
  [Perplexity]][per], as you can explain your exact scenario and what you're
  looking for, but also what things you absolutely can't live with, and what you
  could live with.

  For example, you could say "We are family of 4, I require school access, but
  as I work remotely, I don't require any particular transport links" or
  something like "I'm a single man, working in London, with no need for school
  or transport links, as long as I can get to work within 1 hour, and I don't
  mind being in a noisy area as I go to bed late".

  There are probably better examples, but I'm sure you get the idea.

  I think if you had an AI model that had full access to a property database,
  with enough information that it could understand the fine details of each
  property, placing a prompt-based interface on top of that would be perfect.
