I'm pleased to announce a new project of mine, [Journeys Through Glass](https://journeysthroughglass.net/). It is a new blog by myself, where I will document my journey using the iPad as a primary device. From my introduction:

> Around two weeks ago, we got to see the iPad get a hint at a new life, in the form of iPadOS 26. That made me wonder if this could spark a revival of my usage of my iPad. - ["The Start of a Journey"](https://journeysthroughglass.net/the-start-of-a-journey/)

Alongside an introduction to the site, you can also find my first real post, which are [my initial thoughts on iPadOS 26](https://journeysthroughglass.net/initial-thoughts-on-ipados-26/).

I'll still be posting here, but anything related to my iPad journey will be posted on my new blog!
