> If you print this page, you’ll get a nifty calendar that displays all of the year’s dates on a single page. It will automatically fit on a single sheet of paper of any size. For best results, adjust your print settings to landscape orientation and disable the header and footer.

I just came across [this via Hacker News](https://neatnik.net/calendar/?year=2026). It seems to scale and adapt well to any
size and orientation.

I think I may end up printing this out at work. Could be a good way to visualise the year.
