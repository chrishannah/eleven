Ever since I started writing on the internet, I've had a tendency to want to constantly start from scratch, switch platforms, change domain name, etc. And this year hasn't been any different.

I've toyed with various ideas, and a few of them have actually seen the light of day. So I thought now was a good time to run through where I'm currently writing, and what to expect from each.

## Code and Culture ([codeandculture.uk](https://codeandculture.uk))

This is the newest writing project of mine. It is essentially a place where I can put my more *serious* writing. In fact, in my plans for this blog, it should support three types of content:

- **Observations**: These are more immediate reaction pieces, and quick takes on topics.
- **Thoughts**: Pieces where I have started to explore an idea more deeply.
- **Essays**: Long-form pieces with substantial thinking and research.

I've written some short essays in the past, and there are definitely some posts where I've really gone deep into an idea. But I wanted a clear place for my more thought-out writing. And this is it.

I published my first observation post on this blog a week ago, which is about [my thoughts on when you become an adult](https://codeandculture.uk/when-adulthood-actually-arrives/).

## Journeys Through Glass ([journeysthroughglass.net](https://journeysthroughglass.net))

Another site which also follows the idea of separating a category of content away from my personal blog.

This time it started as a way to clearly separate a journey of using the iPad Pro more during the iPadOS 26 beta.

However, after [the iPad experiment came to a bit of a dead end](https://journeysthroughglass.net/i-need-to-talk-about-the-ipad-again/), it also served as the place where I wrote about my next journey, which was to start using [Omarchy on a new Framework laptop](https://journeysthroughglass.net/a-new-journey/).

As the name suggests, this blog is where I will post updates on the various journeys I take through the technology I use.

## Chris Hannah ([chrishannah.me](https://chrishannah.me))

The blog you're reading now. My personal blog that has content going back to 2013.

I have to admit, it's a bit of a mess right now, and there's a bunch of old rubbish I want to clear out eventually.

But another reason why I wanted to separate some writing onto other sites, is that this is my *personal* blog. So it's going to be messy sometimes. It's going to be a place where I share photos, links to videos, really quick thoughts, and opinions that probably won't hold up for very long.

When I think about what I want this site to be, it's a playground. Somewhere that isn't too serious. Where things may break, posts may be deleted, and the design will be radically altered without any notice.

I *want* to post here more often. But my decision to use [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) has added a bit of friction that isn't always welcome. Nevertheless, that's a problem that I'll try to fix.
